    <title>Week 5: Debt and Debt Management</title>
    <p>
        In our previous week, we considered some components of the loan world.
        Your credit is invaluable tool in applying for loans, and credit cards are a particular kind of loan.
        This week, we’ll focus on the properties of loans in general.
        We will also look at the nature of debt and techniques for getting out of debt.

        <title>Properties of Loans</title>
       <p>
            Most of us will need to take out loans throughout our lives.
            Car loans, mortgages, student loans, etc.
            are all extremely common and make up a huge part of the American and global economies.
            However, not all loans are created equal.
            Understanding the components or <alert>terms</alert> of loans can help you save a lot of money in the long run.
        </p>
        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Principal">
            <title>Principal</title>
            <p>
                When you borrow money, the amount that you borrow is called the <alert>principal.</alert> It is the base amount that you need to pay back.
                As you repay your loan over time, some of your payments will go toward what you owe (the principal) and reduce that amount.
                Once you pay back the entire principal amount, you have repaid the loan.
            </p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Balance">
            <title>Balance</title>
            <p>
                At any moment in time, the amount you owe on a loan is your <alert>balance</alert>.
                As you make payments on your loan, the balance of your loan (usually) decreases.
                Once your balance has reached $0, you will have paid off your loan and don’t owe any more payments.
                For example, suppose you take out a loan of $1,000.
                The principal on your loan is $1,000, and that is your balance.
                Suppose that your first payment is $250 where $200 “goes toward the principal” and $50 is interest/fees.
                Then after the payment, your balance drops to $800.
            </p>

            <p>
                Here is an important thing about balances.
                Your balance will increase if you don’t make payments.
                This is because of interest.
                Take the last scenario where you had $50 in interest.
                If you didn’t make that $250 payment, your balance would have increase to $1,050 (the $1,000 previous balance plus the $50 in interest).
                As we’ll discuss next, higher balances means even more that you’ll pay in interest.
            </p>

        </subsection>    

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Term">
            <title>Term</title>
            <p>
                The <alert>term</alert> of your loan is the length or amount of time it will take to pay off the loan.
                For installment loans, like car loans and mortgages, the term is agreed upon at the start of the loan.
                For example, mortgages generally have terms of 10, 15 or 30 years.
                Car loans typically have terms of 4 to 7 years.
                Payday loans typically have terms of a few weeks or a month.
            </p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Collateral">
            <title>Collateral</title>
            <p>
                When a bank loans you money, they are taking on the risk of you not paying them back.
                Sometimes, a loan will require something of great value that you agree you would give up if you cannot pay back your loan.
                This item of great value is called “collateral.” Some loans naturally have collateral.
                With a mortgage, the house is the collateral.
                For car loans, the car is collateral.
                With smaller, personal loans, it is sometimes the case that you need to choose an item of value (e.g.
                car, jewelry, etc.) to place as collateral.
                Loans with collateral agreements tend to require less in interest payments due to the decrease in risk of not getting paid back.
            </p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Interest">
            <title>Interest</title>
            <p>
                Most loans are not free.
                Imagine you are a bank, and someone asks for $1,000 with a promise to pay it back.
                Why would you give them that loan? If they only paid back $1,000 and nothing else, that is simply bad business for your bank.
                Instead of loaning that $1,000, you could have used it to invest it.
                Further, there is a risk that the person won’t pay back that $1,000.
                So, as compensation for both losing the opportunity to invest that $1,000 and taking on the risk of not getting the money back, you want to charge the borrow extra money.
                This extra money is <alert>interest</alert>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Interest is what makes loans possible.
                By giving out a loan with interest, the loan is a kind of investment.
                By taking on the risk of lending money, the bank expects investment compensation via interest.
            </p>

            <p>
                Interest is one of the most important, and most complex, terms of a loan.
                How large interest payments are and how they’re calculated can heavily impact how much someone can borrow and how well they’ll be able to pay off the loan.
                We discuss this next.
            </p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Fees">
            <title>Fees</title>
            <p>
                Some loans cost money to actually process and start.
                For example, taking out a loan for a mortgage requires work to transfer the deed to you.
                It requires a title office and a lawyer, among other things.
                These fees are generally paid by the person taking out the loan.
                This can happen in two ways.
                In one way, the loanee pays all the fees up front when the loan begins.
                However, since most people don’t have the needed money to pay fees up front, fee costs are paid in small increments as the loanee pays back the loan.
            </p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-APR">
            <title>APR</title>
            <p>
                For the vast majority of loans, interest is calculated based on the <alert>APR</alert> or <alert>annual percentage rate</alert>.
                For simplicity, let’s assume that loan payments are made once a year.
                Suppose you have a loan balance of $10,000.
                If your APR is 6%, then the amount of interest you need to pay at the end of the year is <m>10,000 \times 0.06 = \$600</m>.
                Now, if your APR was 15% instead, then the amount of interest you need to pay at the end of the year is <m>10,000\times 0.15 = \$1,500</m>.
                As you can see, when you take out a loan, you generally want the lowest APR possible.
            </p>

            <p>
                What your APR will be is determine by a few factors.
                The type of loan (mortgage, car, payday, etc.) is a big factor.
                Below are some ranges of current APR’s for types of loans:

            <p>
                You’ll notice vastly different rates for different types of loans.
                As we’ll explore later, there are reasons behind these differences.
            </p>

            <p>
                Your credit is also a major determinant of your APR.
                Because interest payments are compensation for the risk of lending you money and your credit is a measurement of how likely you are to pay back money, it makes sense that those with higher credit would need to pay less in interest (lower APR).
                Those with lower credit would need higher APR’s.
            </p>

            <p>
                Other factors of APR’s include the length or term of your loan and whether there is any collateral.
            </p>

            <p>
                There is one little fib I made about APR.
                Technically, APR doesn’t count just interest.
                It also includes fees on the loan.
                You may see loans rates advertised with two percentages: the “rate” and the APR.
                The loan rate is what is used to calculate just interest.
                The APR is used to calculate interest and fees combined.
                Effectively, the APR can be used to calculate your actual loan payments.
            </p>

    <section xml:id="sec-How-Interest-Compounds">
        <title>How Interest Compounds</title>
        <p>
            Just as a trigger warning, there will be some math in this section.
            You do not need to worry about formulas are the direct calculations.
            What you need to take away is <em>the power of compound interest.</em>
        </p>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Compounding">
            <title>Compounding</title>
            <p>
                Most loans have what is called <alert>compound interest</alert>.
                Rather than defining it, let’s look at an example.
                Suppose you take out a loan of $10,000 with an APR of 12%.
                After a year, the amount of interest owed is <m>10,000 \times 0.12 = \$1,200</m>.
                Now, suppose you don’t make any payments.
                Then the balance of your loan becomes <m>10,000 + 1,200 = \$11,200</m>.
                When interest “compounds,” we mean that further interest owe is calculated not just on the principal, but previous interest amounts.
                So, after the second year, the amount of interest accumulated would be <m>11,200\times 0.12 = \$1,344</m>.
                Notice that this is quite a bit higher than the first year’s interest.
                Again, if you don’t make a payment, the balance would become <m>11,200 + 1,344 = \$12,544</m>.
                The third year’s interest would be <m>12,544\times 0.12 = \$1,505.28</m>.
                It just keeps going and going.
            </p>

            <p>
                What is vital to understand is that, because interest compounds, it can be very easy for loan balances to get out of control.
                The higher the APR, the easier it is to fall into unmanageable debt.
            </p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Conversion-Periods">
            <title>Conversion Periods and Effective APR</title>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, APR is not quite as simple as we’ve been using it.
                This is because of what is called “conversion periods” or “compounding periods.” In our prior calculations, we have been imagining that interest payments are calculated at the end of each year.
                In reality, most interest payment amounts are calculated each month or each day.
            </p>

            <p>
                Here is how it works.
                Suppose that you take out a car loan for $20,000 that offers a 12% APR that is “compounded monthly.” Since there are 12 months in a years, the amount of interest charged in a month is <m>\frac{12\%}{12}= 1\%</m>.
                So, after one month, you owe <m>20,000 \times 0.01 = \$200</m> in interest.
                If you don’t make a payment, your balance is $20,200.
                Your next interest amount owed after the next month is then <m>20,200 \times 0.01 = \$202</m>.
                If you made no payments for a year, you would actually have total interest accumulated as $2,536.
                Notice that this is not 12% of $20,000.
                It is actually 12.68% of $20,000.
                This 12.68% rate is sometimes called the “effective APR.”
            </p>

            <p>
                If in the example above, interest were compounded every day, the total interest owed at the end of one year would be $2,550, which is even more.
                It is about 12.74% of the $20,000.
            </p>

            <p>
                What to take away from this is that not all APR’s are equal.
                A 5% APR that is compounded monthly accumulates less interest than a 5%APR compounded daily.
                It is something to keep in mind.
            </p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Activity-Why-APR-Matters">
            <title>Activity: Why APR Matters</title>
            <p>
                For this activity, you will look at how APR and loan length can affect how much you actually pay on loans.
                You will look at two common loan types.
                First, open up this calculator: <url href="https://www.calculator.net/payment-calculator.html">https://www.calculator.net/payment-calculator.html</url>

                        <p>
                            Suppose you would like to borrow $250,000 to purchase a home, which is a very reasonable amount.
                            <ol>
                                <li>

                                        Suppose you have a 15-year term.
                                        Currently, possible APR’s for a 15-year mortgage are about 6.1%to 8.0%.
                                        For each of the following APR’s: 6.1%, 7.2%and 8.0%, use the calculator to find what your monthly payments will be and the total interest paid over the life of the loan.

        <title>How to Get a Loan</title>
        <p>
            Ultimately, to get a loan, you need to apply for one.  
            There are a number of factors that will determine if you will be approved for a loan and the loan terms.
        </p>
        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Credit-loans">
            <title>Credit</title>
            <p>
                The better credit you have, the more likely you are to be approved for a loan and the better terms you’ll get on a loan.  
                Recall that your credit rating is determined by the following:
            </p>

            <p>
                -Payment history.  Lenders want to see a long history of your bill payments being made on time.
            </p>
            <p>
               -Current loan balances.  Lenders prefer to see that you have not borrowed too much money and like to see smaller loan balances. 
            </p>
            <p>
                -Credit age.  Lenders like to see a lot of history with lines of credit.  The longer you have been managing money well, the better.
            </p>
            <p>
                -Credit mix.  Lenders like to see a diverse history of finances.  A broader range of types of loans and bills in your recent history, the better.
            </p>
            <p>
                -Credit inquiries.  Frequently applying for loans is a red flag to lenders.  Try to only apply for lines of credit only when you need it.
            </p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Debt-to-Income-Ratio">
            <title>Debt-to-Income Ratio</title>
            <p>
                Lenders want to make sure that you’ll be able to pay back any loan you take out.
                The biggest factor in being able to pay back a loan is simply being able to afford the loan payments in your budget.
                One way lenders measure this ability is to look at your <alert>debt-to-income ratio</alert>.
                Your debt-to-income ratio (DTI) is calculated as the total amount you pay on your debts each month divided by your monthly <alert>gross</alert> income (before taxes).
            </p>

            <p>
                Note that your DTI is based on your gross (before taxes) income.
                This can be confusing, considering that most personal budgets are based on take-home (after taxes) income.
                For example, if your gross monthly income is <m>4,000, taxes are</m>1,000, and you pay $1,500 on debts each month.
                Then you have <m>3,000 for your monthly budget, and your DTI is</m>1,5004,000 = 0.375<m>or 37.5  A rough rule of thumb is that lenders prefer to see a debt-to-income ratio under 36\%, \textbf{including the loan for which you are applying}.
                For example, suppose your gross monthly pay is \$2,000 and that you already pay</m>300 on student loans and <m>320 on a car loan each month.
                Then your current DTI is</m>300+3202,000 = 0.31$ or 31%.
                Suppose you want a credit card.
                The credit card company will look at how much debt you can handle.
                If a “safe’’ DTI is 36%(which is $720 our of your gross $2,000), the company may deem you only being able to handle $100 per month in additional debt.
                While the credit card bank may not reject your credit card application in this scenario, it is unlikely that they’ll give you a high credit limit.
            </p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Employment-History">
            <title>Employment History</title>
            <p>
                For some loans, particularly long-term loans like car loan and mortgages, it is not just your current income that matters but your employment history.
                Jobs can come and go; lenders know this.
                Suppose you just landed a great, high-paying job a week ago that will allow you to afford a new car and a house.
                Lenders are unlikely to approve of these loans for a while.
                The reason is that one of the biggest reasons people lose their jobs is that they simply don’t work out.
                Maybe your new job turns out to be toxic for you.
                Maybe they don’t find your work satisfactory or you don’t survive a probationary period.
                Maybe the position itself was unstable.
                In general, people who have been in a position for a while are more likely to stay employed.
                So, lenders want to see stability in your employment history.
                Even after landing a great new job, you may have to wait a few months before taking out a loan.
            </p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Other-Factors">
            <title>Other Factors</title>
            <p>
                As discussed earlier, collateral can act as a way to reduce the risk of lending you money.
                For some loans, you can put up something as collateral to make the bank more comfortable with loaning you money.
                For some loans, collateral is part of the loan.
                Your house is collateral for a mortgage.
                Your car is collateral for a car loan.
                Your house is collateral for a home-equity loan.
            </p>

            <p>
                The purpose of the loan will also play a factor.
                For some kinds of loans, the purpose is clear: mortgages, car loans, student loans, etc.
                For others, you may need to describe the purpose of the loan, and the bank will take that into consideration.
                Purposes for which the bank could more reliably get their money back in case of emergencies will be seen more favorably.
                For example, applying for a home equity loan to upgrade your kitchen is seen as less risky; your house will be used as collateral, and the lent money for the kitchen will increase its value.
                On the other hand, borrowing money to buy a bunch of crypto currency would be seen as incredibly risk since the bank wouldn’t be able to recover much of its money if the crypto you buy tanks.

                            The loan would add $500 per month in monthly debt payments.

        <p>
            There are some people out there that don’t miss a chance to take advantage of someone in a rough position.
            In the world of loans, some people try to sweep people in <alert>predatory loans</alert>.
            Predatory loans are loans made to people with little regard to their financial health.
            Most predatory loans come with extremely high APR’s and can quickly trap people in a cycle of debt.
        </p>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Targets">
            <title>Targets</title>
            <p>
                Most predatory lenders target one of two kinds of people.
                The first are people in a tough financial position.
                For example, if someone comes back to their apartment from work to find an eviction notice for nonpayment of rent, but their next paycheck won’t come for a while, that person may be desperate enough to take out a high-interest loan to pay that late rate.
                Pay-day lenders, among others, target people in tough financial positions like this.
                The second targets are people with lower financial literacy and knowledge of loans.
                In particular, lenders may try to target people with higher present bias than others, advertising quick access to large amounts of cash while hiding the high APR in the background.
                This lending tactic is extremely common, and even the biggest banks look for these targets.
                (If you have a credit card, I guarantee that the company occasionally tries to advertise cash-advance loans to you.
                Don’t.)
