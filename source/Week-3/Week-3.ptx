        <title>An Introduction to Credit</title>
        <p>
            Let’s look at a few very realistic scenarios.
        </p>

                    Alex and Alexa are in the market for their first home.
                    A clean, updated home in a nice neighborhood has just gone on the market for $300,000.
                    They have saved for a 20% down payment plus closing costs.
                    So, they need to borrow $240,000.
                    Banks are currently advertising 5.8% 30-year fixed rates.
                    This would make the basic mortgage cost $1,408 per month.
                    With taxes and insurance, their monthly mortgage payment is $2,074.
                    This amount would just fit into their possible housing budget.
                    When they apply for the loan, they are told that their credit is not great and that the interest rate is going to be 7.2%.
                    This change in interest rate raises the basic loan payment to $1,629, a $221 difference.
                    Alex and Alexa could move a little around in their budget, but not $221.
                    They decide to leave off on buying a home for a few more years.

            Jordan was laid off from work for a number of months during a recession, but they have have just accepted a new job in Boston.
            They don’t have a car and need to live somewhere with decent public transportation options to downtown.
            They have been putting in applications for several apartments, but they are rejected every time.
            They are told that tenants with better credit ratings are the ones chosen to rent the places.
            During their unemployed time, Jordan had to miss a number of bill payments, but they are starting to catch up.
            No landlord is willing to accept their explanation of their situation and choose to just “go with the numbers.” Jordan has to now choose between not taking their new job or living in a place in which the daily commute is hours long.
        </p>

        <p>
            The two scenarios above are not particularly wild or extreme.
            In fact, they are very common.
            Having poor credit can cost you in terms of money, time, and stress.
            The importance of credit has become so mainstream that an entire industry has been built around it.

                    When you hear the term “credit” in the context of personal finance, it refers to a measurement on how trustworthy you are with regards to paying your bills and paying back loans you take out.
                    Giving someone a loan is a risky thing.
                    If someone is unable to pay what they owe you, it can be a very time-consuming endeavor to recuperate even part of the money you are owed.
                    If you are a landlord, it can take 6 to 18 months to evict someone who stops paying rent.
                    So, landlords tend to only rent to those who have shown they can and will pay their bills.
                    Some insurance companies even demand more in monthly premiums to someone with more risky bill-payment history.
                    Some employers may check your credit as well as a gauge of how “responsible” you are.
                    So, it is paramount to your financial health to build and maintain “good credit.”

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-measure-credit">
            <title>How Credit is Measured</title>
            <sidebyside widths="55% 40%" margins="0% 0%" valign="middle">
                <p>
                    There are two measurements of your credit.
                    The first measurement is your <alert>credit report</alert>.
                    In actuality, you have a number of credit reports.
                    Each “reporting bureaus” has their own report.
                    The three biggest reporting bureaus are TransUnion, Equifax, and Experian.
                    These credit reports give a snapshot of your current and recent experiences in loan and bill payments.
                    When you apply for a loan or some other thing that requires a “hard inquiry” into your credit, lenders will look at this credit report to make a decision.
                    A credit report will list things like, how much you still owe on your house/car, what your current monthly payments on loans are, credit card 
                    balances, credit card limits, bankruptcies, financial lawsuits, previous credit inquiries, and which monthly payments you have made on time.
                </p>

                </figure>
            </sidebyside>

            <p>
                The second option of credit measurement is a <alert>credit score</alert>.
                A credit score is simply a single number that summarizes your credit.
                The larger the score, the better.
                Each reporting bureau can use its own method and scale for credit scores.
                There used to be more difference in possible ranges for credit scores, but most models now put all credit scores between 350 and 850.
                The point of a credit score is to give a somewhat-universal measurement of credit that shouldn’t open any more doors to biases in decisions regarding loans.

    <section xml:id="sec-build-credit">
        <title>Building Good Credit</title>
        <p>
            Let's dive into building credit.
        </p>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-determine-credit">
            <title>What Determines Your Credit?</title>
            <p>
                In this section, we’ll go through the main contributors to your credit report and scores in order of how big of an impact they have.
            </p>

            <p>
                - <alert>Payment History.</alert> (<alert>Very high impact.</alert>) The most important factor in your credit is your history of making payments on loans and certain bills.
                Missing even one payment can wreck havoc on your credit score.
                While not as bad, late payments also can drastically impact your credit.
                Note that a payment is not counted as “late” until it is 30 days past due.
                So, if you have a credit card payment due on July 1st, as long as you pay it by July 31st, the payment is not considered “late” in terms of impacting your credit.
            </p>

            <p>
                When you pay certain bills, the lender or company will report to the credit bureaus that you have made a payment on time.
                If you are late with a payment or miss a payment, they will likewise report so.
                It takes dozens of reported on-time payments to build your credit up, but it only takes one bad month to lower your score.
                Now all bill payments are reported to credit bureaus.
                All loan payments, such as mortgages, auto loans, equity loans, and personal loans are reported to credit bureaus each month.
                Rent <em>can</em> be reported, but that is up to your landlord to do so.
                Generally, rent payments are not reported unless you miss payments.
                Similarly, utilities, phone, TV, and insurance bills <em>can</em> be reported, but are usually not.
                If you do miss payments, these companies are more likely to sell your debt to a collections agency, which absolutely will report your missing bill payments.
                Fines and tickets are not reported in Massachusetts.
            </p>

            <p>
                Medical debt is tricky.
                It only takes one small thing to happen for medical debt to pile up.
                If you have an emergency medical procedure that your insurance doesn’t cover, you could be looking at hundreds of thousands of medical bills.
                A common false belief is that missed payments on medical debt can’t be reported for Massachusetts residents.
                This is false.
                It absolutely can.
                Many medical providers choose not to report themselves, but collections agencies absolutely will.
                However, since medical debt is seen as involuntary debt (choosing to take out an auto loan is never life-or-death), there is some leniency.
                First, medical debt of less than $500 will never hurt your credit.
                This is because it is really common to have to fight with your medical insurance company over co-pay amounts and whatnot, which takes time.
                Second, once your unpaid medical payments are reported to a credit bureau, the bureau cannot legally affect your credit report for 365 days from the day they are told about your missed payments.
                Paid medical debt is no longer report as well, meaning once you pay medical debt that went to collections, it is removed from your report.
                Further, some credit score models do not take into account unpaid medical debt.
                There are talks about eliminating all medical debt from credit reports, but that is looking less likely under the proposed goals of the new administration and legislature.
            </p>

            <p>
                - <alert>Amount Owed.</alert> (<alert>Very high impact.</alert>) In general, the more you owe, the more risky it is to let you borrow more money.
                Even you you have a very high income and can afford a large mortgage or auto loan, large loan amounts will hurt your credit.
            </p>

            <p>
                Percentage of <alert>credit utilization</alert> also affects your score.
                Owing $10,000 in credit card debt is much worse if your credit limit is $15,000 versus $50,000.
                (66.7%credit utilization versus 20%.) Ideally, you want to keep your credit utilization below 10%of your total “revolving-credit” accounts.
                (<em>Revolving credit</em> is a type of open-ended loan in which you can borrow up to a pre-approved amount.
                Credit cards and home-equity loans are examples of these.)
            </p>

            <p>
                - <alert>Length of Credit History.</alert> (<alert>Moderate impact.</alert>) This is one you don’t have much control over.
                Lenders, employers, etc.
                would prefer to see you have 25 years of good credit history versus one year of credit history.
                Credit history is usually determined to be either the age of your oldest account or the average age of all your accounts.
                For example, if you opened your first credit card five years ago and opened a second credit card one year ago and no other types of accounts, your “credit age” could be either 5 years or 3 years (average of 1 and 5), depending on the reporter’s model.
                I didn’t pull 25 years out of thin air.
                That is usually the credit age needed for the best positive impact to your score.
                Again, don’t stress over credit age.
                Once you have an account open, you just have to wait.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are some nuances to this.
                If you pay off a loan, that account is called “closed.” Closed accounts stay on your credit report for up to ten years and continue to contribute to the “age” of your credit.
                After 10 years, closed accounts disappear, suddenly changing your “credit age.” Also, not using available credit can be seen negatively.
                Some credit card companies close your credit cards if you do not use them for some period of time (often a year).
                So, it is in your best interest, if you can, to keep your oldest account open.
            </p>

            <p>
                - <alert>Credit Mix.</alert> (<alert>Lower impact.</alert>) Lenders like to see that you are capable of paying a variety of types of bills.
                Having one credit card and no other types of accounts or loans makes it look like you have too narrow of credit history.
                So, most credit reporting models favor having kinds of both installment debt (mortgage, student loans, etc.) and revolving accounts (credit cards and equity loans).
                Even though have a broader mix of credit types helps your credit score, <alert>the impact is not worth taking out new loans or opening more credit cards just to improve your credit score.
                Be smart about loans and credit cards.</alert>
            </p>

            <p>
                - <alert>Credit Inquiries and New Accounts</alert> (<alert>Lower impact.</alert>) Statistically, if you take on more debt, you are more likely to miss a payment on older debt.
                So, opening new accounts tends to lower your credit rating.
            </p>

            <p>
                First, when a company or person needs to check your credit report, they “pull you credit report” or “run an inquiry.” When you apply for a home loan, the bank will pull your credit report to determine if they are willing to give you a loan and what rate they are willing to give you.
                Even if you do not actually take out the loan, this credit check will hurt your credit rating a bit.
                There are two types of credit checks.
                A <em>soft credit check</em> is a check companies do to find out who they would like to offer you something.
                Credit card companies are the biggest users of soft inquiries in that they look for people with scores in certain ranges to market particular credit cards.
                Since you do not authorize these checks, soft credit inquiries do not affect your credit at all.
                A <em>hard credit check</em> is one that a lender will do when you apply for a loan or credit card.
                These do lower your credit rating.
            </p>

            <p>
                The decrease in credit ratings from hard credit inquiries is usually small and very temporary, assuming you make payments on all your bills on time.
                Further, if you “rate-shop” and apply for loans at a few places in a short time-frame, those multiple checks are often counted as only one “credit inquiry.”
