            <title>Kinds of Taxes</title>
            <p>
                There are <alert>a lot</alert> of different kinds of taxes in the United States.
                We’ll go over some of the most common.
            </p>

            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <em>Payroll Taxes</em> - These taxes fund Social Security and Medicare. These taxes are taken out of your paycheck automatically. Your employer and you split these taxes. If you work for yourself, you will need to pay these when you file your taxes. These programs provide retirement and health benefits (old-age insurance is more accurate) to the elderly and some health benefits to certain people. These taxes are levied by the Federal government.

                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <em>Income Taxes</em> - Income taxes are taxes you pay on many of your earnings over a year. Your paychecks, investment returns, small-business earnings, and other sources of income are taxed. These taxes are taken out of your paycheck automatically. If work for yourself, you pay these taxes when you file your taxes. The Federal government levies income taxes. Some stats also levy income taxes (like Massachusetts).
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <alert>Property Taxes</alert> - If you own property, you will pay taxes on it. The amount you pay is based on the value of the property and the tax rate set by the local government. These taxes fund local goods and services like building schools, many aspects of public safety, construction of parks, etc. Local governments, like cities or counties levy property taxes.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <alert>Excise Taxes</alert> - These are taxes on particular goods. Some products, like alcohol, cigarettes, gas, etc. have excise taxes on them. These taxes sometimes have special purposes. (For example, gas excise taxes often fund road construction/repair.) These taxes are levied by the Federal, state, and local governments.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <alert>Sales Taxes</alert> - Many products you buy are subject to these taxes. Sales tax is a fixed proportion of the sale price of a purchased good or service that is paid to a state and/or government. Not all states have sales taxes. Many products are exempt from sales tax in some states. (For example, clothing and food from grocers are exempt from sales tax in Massachusetts.) Formally, the seller of an good or service pays the sales tax, but that cost is put on the buyer and charged to them at the time of the sale.

            <p>
                There are many other kinds of taxes in the US.
                There are inheritance taxes (taxes on inherited wealth beyond $1M, paid to state and Federal governments); occupancy taxes (takes paid on short-term lodging, paid to local governments); corporate taxes (taxes paid by corporations on profits they earn, paid to Federal and state governments); and tariffs (taxes paid on goods being imported or exported, paid to the Federal government); among others.
