    <title>Week 2: Introduction, Money Psychology, and Setting Financial Goals</title>
    <p>
        Welcome to our second week of Money and You!  In this week, we will explore budgets.  A budget is simply a plan for how you will 
        spend your money over a certain time period.

        <title>Do You Need a Budget?</title>
        <p>
            Yes.  Yes you do.

            <p>
                Every part of our capitalist society is devoted to trying to get your to spend your money.  Our society makes it really easy 
                for you to buy products or services with little to no thought.  One of the biggest reasons people go into debt or are 
                unable to ever retire is because they overspend their paychecks.
            </p>

        <p>
            And it's really easy to overspend.  Don't have enough in your bank account for that manicure?  Credit card.  Need a flashier 
            car?  Payment plan.  Need a bit of spending cash for the holidays?  Cash advance.  (These are not advice for these scenarios.  
            Please don't do them.  They're just examples of how easier it is the spend money you don't have.)  A budget can be a tool that 
            can help teach you discipline and fiscal responsibility.  A budget is essentially the backbone or core of financial well-being.  
            It is the foundation upon which other financial skills will be built.
        </p>

        <p>
            A budget will help track where your money goes.  Setting a budget for the first time can be quite eye-opening.  
            Most people find that they spend far more on certain things than they think.  A budget will help you set and achieve 
            STAR goals.  By putting goals into your budget, you are better set for reaching them.  A budget can help payoff your 
            debts or help prevent falling into debt.  Debt is expensive, and it generally isn't good to fall into unmanageable debt.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now, I'll tell you the truth.  I do not currently set a budget for myself.  I used to, but after getting an intuitive 
            sense of how much I can spend and save each paycheck, I can confidently go through each month without overspending and 
            managing to have an emergency fund for unplanned expenses.  This is not because I'm wealthy.  I'm the lowest paid 
            associate professor in the Massachusetts state college system.  This is because I set a strict budget for myself that 
            I followed until it became habit.  When people say they can live comfortably, this scenario is usually what they mean.  
            For most, it doesn't happen overnight.  It takes time.

        <title>Budgeting Rules</title>
        <p>
            In this section, we'll explore a few popular budgeting rules.  There are general strategies for planning to spend your paychecks.  
            Not all rules will fit everyone's situation, so it can take some trial-and-error to find one that works for you.

            <title>The 50-30-20 Rule</title>
            <sidebyside widths="40% 50%" margins="0% 0%" valign="middle">
                <p>
                    Here is the rule.  Your <em>after-tax income</em> (<q>take-home pay</q>) should be allocated so that 50% is spent on <q>needs,</q> 
                    30% is spent on <q>wants,</q> and 20% is saved.  That's it.  Let's break down these three categories.
                </p>

            <p>
                <term>Needs</term> - A <em>need</em> is a necessity that you cannot do without.  Housing, utilities, food, supplies, 
                insurance, clothing, and transportation are examples of things considered necessities.  Other things can definitely be 
                considered <q>needs,</q> based on your individual situation.  
            </p>

            <p>
                <term>Wants</term> - A <em>want</em> is something that you would like to have but isn't strictly necessary for your 
                survival.  Eating out, entertainment, coffee, luxury items, and cosmetics are examples of things considered wants.
            </p>

            <p>
                <term>Savings</term> - A <em>savings</em> item is simply an account in which you put money you do not spend that can be used 
                for the future.  Retirement accounts, savings accounts, and swear jars are all examples of things considered to be savings 
                items.
            </p>

                <p>
                    Sounds simple, right?  Here is one of the biggest barriers to the 50-30-20 rule.  Most people are reluctant to label 
                    some desirable items as a <q>want.</q>  Thinking to yourself, <q>I couldn't live without coffee,</q> doesn't make it a need.  
                    If you live where there is robust public transportation, owning a car may not be considered a need.  Pet supplies are 
                    tricky.  Is owning a pet a necessity?  Most people with pets are hesitant to say no.  What about Internet access?  It 
                    may be a necessity, but is the highest speed possible a necessity?  
                </p>

                Here is an important truth.  <em>If the thought of not having something makes you uncomfortable, that doesn't make 
                the thing automatically a necessity.</em>

                Let's practice categorizing things as needs, wants, or savings.  For each item/scenario, classify each as a need, a want, 
                or savings.  Pick only one.  For each, explain your answer in one sentence.

            <title>Allocating Money under the 50-30-20 Rule</title>
            <p>
                Once you can categorize spending, you can get into the actual meat of the 50-30-20 plan.  
                It can be tedious, and it requires you to have a very detailed and realistic record of your spending.  
                Here is the rough steps in creating your budget.
            </p>

            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            First, determine how much money you make in a month.
                            (You can also do it by week or by paycheck.
                            However, since bills are usually paid monthly, it is best to budget monthly.) Your paycheck will likely be the biggest source of income, but there may be other sources.
                            Any money that you take in counts.
                            Make sure to only count what you actually get (the “net” amount).
                            For example, if you work a job for 40 hours a week at $21 per hour, your weekly pay is <m>40 \times 21 = $840</m>.
                            However, that is not what you actually get because of taxes.
                            To simplify things, if you have an annual salary, take that amount and divide by 12 your monthly pay.
                            If you are paid bi-weekly, multiply your paychecks by 2 to get your monthly amount.
                            For weekly paychecks, multiply by 4.
                            If your paychecks vary from check to check, do your best to come up with a monthly average.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Determine how much you can allocate to each category.
                            For needs, we want 50%of your income.
                            So, take your monthly income and multiply by 0.5.
                            For wants, take your income and multiply by 0.3.
                            For savings, take your income and multiply by 0.2.
                            For example, suppose your monthly income is $3,400.
                            Then you can have <m>3,400 \times 0.5 = \$1,700</m> devoted to needs, <m>3,400 \times 0.3 = \$1,020</m> devoted to 
                            wants, and <m>3,400 \times 0.2 = \$680</m> put into savings.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Make a list of everything you spend money on in a month.
                            You can group things into categories.
                            For example, don’t list out items from the grocery store.
                            Just have one “groceries” item.
                            This is probably the hardest step.
                            Everything counts.
                            Do you buy a mocha only once or twice a week? That’s $20-$40 from your monthly income that you can’t ignore.
                            Be honest with yourself.
                            It may be necessary to look at your credit card bill or debit card statement to really see where and when you spend money.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Categorize your items as needs, wants, or savings.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Add up how much you spend in each category and compare to what amounts you’re allowed.
                            If you over-spend in a category, you may need to change how your finances work, which we’ll go over shortly.
                            Also note that putting too much into savings is not really grounds for alarm.
                            Only if you feel like you’re not enjoying how you’re spending money should you worry about saving too much.
                        </p>

            <title>The 80-20 Budget Plan</title>
            <p>
                Sometimes, the 50-30-20 plan doesn't work.  This is becoming more true for the millennial, Z, and alpha generations as housing 
                costs are increasing more than wages.  It is very common to find yourself in a position where you simply can't allocate 
                only 50% of your paycheck to needs.  One solution to that is to <q>>combine</q> needs and wants into one category in which 
                you allocate 80% of your take-home pay to needs and wants and 20% to savings.
            </p>

            <p>
                Notice something.
                This version of the 50-30-20 plan essentially <em>lowers the amount for wants</em> in exchange for needs.
                It still requires you to save 20%.
                Generally, you should always prioritize saving over wants.
                It is vastly more important that you save for unexpected future expenses and retirement rather than spend on things you don’t need.
            </p>

            <p>
                The main benefit of the 80-20 budget is increased flexibility over the 50-30-20.
            </p>

            <p>
                The increased flexibility of the 80-20 plan does come at a cost.
                Flexibility allows greater freedom.
                Greater freedom allows more opportunity to stray from the budget.
                Simply put, people want wants and do not want to save.
                It is really easy for the 80-20 plan to become the 100-0 plan.
                (The 100-0 plan is not a real plan.
                Please don’t do it.) If you find yourself in a situation where 70%of your paychecks go to necessities like housing, student loans, food, etc., it can be difficult to spend only 10% on stuff you want.
                Feeling overworked or overstressed can make wants feel like needs.
            </p>

            <p>
                Under the 80-20 budget plan, you should still classify spending as needs, wants, and savings.
                it is important for your brain to see that certain spending behaviors are non-essential.

                <p>
                    One of the most classic budgeting methods is the envelope system.
                    On social media, this is now often called “cash stuffing.” Traditionally, the envelope system requires you to take your entire paycheck in physical cash and allocate that cash into different envelopes for different spending activities.
                    You could have a “rent” envelope, a “student loan” envelope, a “groceries” envelope, a “Dunkin”’ envelope, a “savings” envelope, etc.
                </p>
            </sidebyside>

            <p>
                Once you distribute your cash, you do your best not to take money from an envelope for any reason other than its intended purpose.
                For example, don’t take money out of your “groceries” envelope because you want to go out to eat.
            </p>

                <p>
                    This budgeting method is great for people who tend to over-spend on non-necessities.
                    If you find yourself spending money on things you know you shouldn’t, you can try the envelope method.
                    Physically keeping money in labeled envelope can help you see and adhere to your money’s intended purpose.
                    Further, the process of allocating money physically helps you see exactly where your money is going.
                    If you find yourself transferring money from one envelope to another, you are physically seeing that you’re not sticking to your budget.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One big negative drawback of this system is that it requires you to have your money in cash.
                    However, most bills are paid electronically these days.
                    It also requires you to physically go to a bank or ATM to get cash.
                    Further, your paychecks are usually more frequent than billing cycles.
                    So, you have to learn to put parts of needed bill amounts in an envelope with each paycheck.
                    Also, keeping physical cash around your place can be unsafe.

                    There are some apps available that can help set up a digital “envelope system.” We’ll discuss budgeting apps later in this week’s material.

                <p>
                    The zero-based budget is a modern update on the envelope system.
                    Under this system, when you get a paycheck, you meticulous give a purpose to every single dollar.
                    So, you do not have just a “savings” category.
                    You would, for example, say “$50 goes into my rainy-day fund.
                    $50 goes into my retire savings.
                    $20 goes into my fund for a vacation.” Beyond paying for your necessities, there are no requirements on how much goes where.
                </p>

            <p>
                The benefit of the zero-based budget is for you to meticulously track your spending.  No dollar goes unaccounted.  
                Many people find it helpful in recognizing over-spending habits and starting to save more.
            </p>

            <p>
                - First, making more money may be an option.  Ask your boss for a raise.  Look around for a 
                better-paying comparable job.  Take on a small side-gig.  You don't necessarily have to throw your 
                arms up and accept not making enough.  I know this is easier said than done, but it is a real possibility.
            </p>

                    -Suppose you are over-spending in wants.
                    The easiest thing to do is cut back on some of these items that are not essential.
                    Yes, it is uncomfortable saying goodbye to things you get enjoyment from, but it may be necessary.
                    Or perhaps simply altering the want can reduce expenses.
                    For example, going to Chipotle rather than ordering Door Dash will lower that expense.
                    Part of the reason for categorizing things as wants is for you to physically see those things as non-necessities.
                    It can help you make the right, tough decisions.

               <p>
                    -Suppose you are over-spending in needs but not in other areas.
                    This is fairly common with the current cost of housing.
                    This scenario is tougher, and it is one reason why the 50-30-20 isn’t right for some people.
                    It may require you to make some big changes in your life.
                    Getting a roommate if rent is too high, carpooling to work to save on gas, re-housing a pet to a good home if pet 
                    supplies are burdensome, shopping around for better insurance rates, changing Internet providers are all examples 
                    changes that could help your needs spending down.
                </p> 

                <p>
                    -Suppose you are saving more than 20%of your income.
                    This may not be a bad thing if you are meeting your needs and feel satisfied with how many wants you’re able to fulfill.
                    However, if you are saving so much that you are not paying for your needs or are feeling unsatisfied with what wants you’re able to have, it may be ok to allow yourself to spend more.
                    Of course, depending on your savings goals, saving more than 20%may be a necessary part of the plan.
                </p>

                <p>
                    -If you find yourself over-spending on wants and under-saving, I highly recommend setting up automatic deposits or transfers into a long-term savings account that is separate from your spending/checking account.
                    This effective forces you to put part of your paycheck aside for savings and giving you a smaller amount to spend each month.
