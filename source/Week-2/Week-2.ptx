    <title>Week 2: Introduction, Money Psychology, and Setting Financial Goals</title>
    <p>
        Welcome to our second week of Money and You!  In this week, we will explore budgets.  A budget is simply a plan for how you will 
        spend your money over a certain time period.

        <title>Do You Need a Budget?</title>
        <p>
            Yes.  Yes you do.

            <p>
                Every part of our capitalist society is devoted to trying to get your to spend your money.  Our society makes it really easy 
                for you to buy products or services with little to no thought.  One of the biggest reasons people go into debt or are 
                unable to ever retire is because they overspend their paychecks.
            </p>

        <p>
            And it's really easy to overspend.  Don't have enough in your bank account for that manicure?  Credit card.  Need a flashier 
            car?  Payment plan.  Need a bit of spending cash for the holidays?  Cash advance.  (These are not advice for these scenarios.  
            Please don't do them.  They're just examples of how easier it is the spend money you don't have.)  A budget can be a tool that 
            can help teach you discipline and fiscal responsibility.  A budget is essentially the backbone or core of financial well-being.  
            It is the foundation upon which other financial skills will be built.
        </p>

        <p>
            A budget will help track where your money goes.  Setting a budget for the first time can be quite eye-opening.  
            Most people find that they spend far more on certain things than they think.  A budget will help you set and achieve 
            STAR goals.  By putting goals into your budget, you are better set for reaching them.  A budget can help payoff your 
            debts or help prevent falling into debt.  Debt is expensive, and it generally isn't good to fall into unmanageable debt.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now, I'll tell you the truth.  I do not currently set a budget for myself.  I used to, but after getting an intuitive 
            sense of how much I can spend and save each paycheck, I can confidently go through each month without overspending and 
            managing to have an emergency fund for unplanned expenses.  This is not because I'm wealthy.  I'm the lowest paid 
            associate professor in the Massachusetts state college system.  This is because I set a strict budget for myself that 
            I followed until it became habit.  When people say they can live comfortably, this scenario is usually what they mean.  
            For most, it doesn't happen overnight.  It takes time.

        <title>Budgeting Rules</title>
        <p>
            In this section, we'll explore a few popular budgeting rules.  There are general strategies for planning to spend your paychecks.  
            Not all rules will fit everyone's situation, so it can take some trial-and-error to find one that works for you.

            <title>The 50-30-20 Rule</title>
            <sidebyside widths="40% 50%" margins="0% 0%" valign="middle">
                <p>
                    Here is the rule.  Your <em>after-tax income</em> (<q>take-home pay</q>) should be allocated so that 50% is spent on <q>needs,</q> 
                    30% is spent on <q>wants,</q> and 20% is saved.  That's it.  Let's break down these three categories.
                </p>

            <p>
                <term>Needs</term> - A <em>need</em> is a necessity that you cannot do without.  Housing, utilities, food, supplies, 
                insurance, clothing, and transportation are examples of things considered necessities.  Other things can definitely be 
                considered <q>needs,</q> based on your individual situation.  
            </p>

            <p>
                <term>Wants</term> - A <em>want</em> is something that you would like to have but isn't strictly necessary for your 
                survival.  Eating out, entertainment, coffee, luxury items, and cosmetics are examples of things considered wants.
            </p>

            <p>
                <term>Savings</term> - A <em>savings</em> item is simply an account in which you put money you do not spend that can be used 
                for the future.  Retirement accounts, savings accounts, and swear jars are all examples of things considered to be savings 
                items.

                <p>
                    Sounds simple, right?  Here is one of the biggest barriers to the 50-30-20 rule.  Most people are reluctant to label 
                    some desirable items as a <q>want.</q>  Thinking to yourself, <q>I couldn't live without coffee,</q> doesn't make it a need.  
                    If you live where there is robust public transportation, owning a car may not be considered a need.  Pet supplies are 
                    tricky.  Is owning a pet a necessity?  Most people with pets are hesitant to say no.  What about Internet access?  It 
                    may be a necessity, but is the highest speed possible a necessity?

                Here is an important truth.  <em>If the thought of not having something makes you uncomfortable, that doesn't make 
                the thing automatically a necessity.</em>

            <p>
                Let's practice categorizing things as needs, wants, or savings.  For each item/scenario, classify each as a need, a want, 
                or savings.  Pick only one.  For each, explain your answer in one sentence.

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-allocating-50-30-20">
            <title>Allocating Money under the 50-30-20 Rule</title>
            <p>
                Once you can categorize spending, you can get into the actual meat of the 50-30-20 plan.  
                It can be tedious, and it requires you to have a very detailed and realistic record of your spending.  
                Here is the rough steps in creating your budget.
            </p>

            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            First, determine how much money you make in a month.
                            (You can also do it by week or by paycheck.
                            However, since bills are usually paid monthly, it is best to budget monthly.) Your paycheck will likely be the biggest source of income, but there may be other sources.
                            Any money that you take in counts.
                            Make sure to only count what you actually get (the “net” amount).
                            For example, if you work a job for 40 hours a week at $21 per hour, your weekly pay is <m>40 \times 21 = $840</m>.
                            However, that is not what you actually get because of taxes.
                            To simplify things, if you have an annual salary, take that amount and divide by 12 your monthly pay.
                            If you are paid bi-weekly, multiply your paychecks by 2 to get your monthly amount.
                            For weekly paychecks, multiply by 4.
                            If your paychecks vary from check to check, do your best to come up with a monthly average.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Determine how much you can allocate to each category.
                            For needs, we want 50%of your income.
                            So, take your monthly income and multiply by 0.5.
                            For wants, take your income and multiply by 0.3.
                            For savings, take your income and multiply by 0.2.
                            For example, suppose your monthly income is $3,400.
                            Then you can have <m>3,400 \times 0.5 = \$1,700</m> devoted to needs, <m>3,400 \times 0.3 = \$1,020</m> devoted to 
                            wants, and <m>3,400 \times 0.2 = \$680</m> put into savings.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Make a list of everything you spend money on in a month.
                            You can group things into categories.
                            For example, don’t list out items from the grocery store.
                            Just have one “groceries” item.
                            This is probably the hardest step.
                            Everything counts.
                            Do you buy a mocha only once or twice a week? That’s $20-$40 from your monthly income that you can’t ignore.
                            Be honest with yourself.
                            It may be necessary to look at your credit card bill or debit card statement to really see where and when you spend money.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Categorize your items as needs, wants, or savings.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Add up how much you spend in each category and compare to what amounts you’re allowed.
                            If you over-spend in a category, you may need to change how your finances work, which we’ll go over shortly.
                            Also note that putting too much into savings is not really grounds for alarm.
                            Only if you feel like you’re not enjoying how you’re spending money should you worry about saving too much.

            <title>The 80-20 Budget Plan</title>
            <p>
                Sometimes, the 50-30-20 plan doesn't work.  This is becoming more true for the millennial, Z, and alpha generations as housing 
                costs are increasing more than wages.  It is very common to find yourself in a position where you simply can't allocate 
                only 50% of your paycheck to needs.  One solution to that is to <q>>combine</q> needs and wants into one category in which 
                you allocate 80% of your take-home pay to needs and wants and 20% to savings.
            </p>

            <p>
                Notice something.
                This version of the 50-30-20 plan essentially <em>lowers the amount for wants</em> in exchange for needs.
                It still requires you to save 20%.
                Generally, you should always prioritize saving over wants.
                It is vastly more important that you save for unexpected future expenses and retirement rather than spend on things you don’t need.
            </p>

            <p>
                The main benefit of the 80-20 budget is increased flexibility over the 50-30-20.
            </p>

            <p>
                The increased flexibility of the 80-20 plan does come at a cost.
                Flexibility allows greater freedom.
                Greater freedom allows more opportunity to stray from the budget.
                Simply put, people want wants and do not want to save.
                It is really easy for the 80-20 plan to become the 100-0 plan.
                (The 100-0 plan is not a real plan.
                Please don’t do it.) If you find yourself in a situation where 70%of your paychecks go to necessities like housing, student loans, food, etc., it can be difficult to spend only 10% on stuff you want.
                Feeling overworked or overstressed can make wants feel like needs.
            </p>

            <p>
                Under the 80-20 budget plan, you should still classify spending as needs, wants, and savings.
                it is important for your brain to see that certain spending behaviors are non-essential.

                <p>
                    One of the most classic budgeting methods is the envelope system.
                    On social media, this is now often called “cash stuffing.” Traditionally, the envelope system requires you to take your entire paycheck in physical cash and allocate that cash into different envelopes for different spending activities.
                    You could have a “rent” envelope, a “student loan” envelope, a “groceries” envelope, a “Dunkin”’ envelope, a “savings” envelope, etc.
                </p>
            </sidebyside>

            <p>
                Once you distribute your cash, you do your best not to take money from an envelope for any reason other than its intended purpose.
                For example, don’t take money out of your “groceries” envelope because you want to go out to eat.
            </p>

                <p>
                    This budgeting method is great for people who tend to over-spend on non-necessities.
                    If you find yourself spending money on things you know you shouldn’t, you can try the envelope method.
                    Physically keeping money in labeled envelope can help you see and adhere to your money’s intended purpose.
                    Further, the process of allocating money physically helps you see exactly where your money is going.
                    If you find yourself transferring money from one envelope to another, you are physically seeing that you’re not sticking to your budget.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One big negative drawback of this system is that it requires you to have your money in cash.
                    However, most bills are paid electronically these days.
                    It also requires you to physically go to a bank or ATM to get cash.
                    Further, your paychecks are usually more frequent than billing cycles.
                    So, you have to learn to put parts of needed bill amounts in an envelope with each paycheck.
                    Also, keeping physical cash around your place can be unsafe.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There are some apps available that can help set up a digital “envelope system.” We’ll discuss budgeting apps later in this week’s material.

                <p>
                    The zero-based budget is a modern update on the envelope system.
                    Under this system, when you get a paycheck, you meticulous give a purpose to every single dollar.
                    So, you do not have just a “savings” category.
                    You would, for example, say “$50 goes into my rainy-day fund.
                    $50 goes into my retire savings.
                    $20 goes into my fund for a vacation.” Beyond paying for your necessities, there are no requirements on how much goes where.
                </p>

            <p>
                The benefit of the zero-based budget is for you to meticulously track your spending.  No dollar goes unaccounted.  
                Many people find it helpful in recognizing over-spending habits and starting to save more.
            </p>

            <p>
                The zero-based budget requires a lot of work and dedication.  Have you ever tried tracking calories for even just a week?  
                It's hard and tedious.  It's the same thing here.  Every dollar you spend needs to be recorded and tracked.  
                Many people are unable to keep up with the recording, which makes this budget useless.  
                Also, some users of this budget method do not increase their savings amounts and instead simple spend their entire paychecks.  
                Ultimately, it is not really a beginner-friendly approach to budgeting unless you have the disciple to stick to it.

        <title>Balancing Your Budget</title>

        <p>
            Budgeting is a skill that takes time and practice.  
            It is also a matter of psychology.  
            You have to work within the confines of your paychecks and your money personality to create and and adhere to a budget.  
            In this section, we'll look at some ideas in helping you set and maintain a healthy budget.
        </p>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-what-to-do">
            <title>What to Do When Your Budget Isn't Balanced</title>

            <p>
                Generally, when you are unable to make the 50-30-20 plan, or similar plan, work, it is because your spending habits 
                overpower how much income you have.  There are a few things you can do to help get your budget in line.
            </p>

            <p>
                - First, making more money may be an option.  Ask your boss for a raise.  Look around for a 
                better-paying comparable job.  Take on a small side-gig.  You don't necessarily have to throw your 
                arms up and accept not making enough.  I know this is easier said than done, but it is a real possibility.
            </p>

                <p>
                    -Suppose you are over-spending in wants.
                    The easiest thing to do is cut back on some of these items that are not essential.
                    Yes, it is uncomfortable saying goodbye to things you get enjoyment from, but it may be necessary.
                    Or perhaps simply altering the want can reduce expenses.
                    For example, going to Chipotle rather than ordering Door Dash will lower that expense.
                    Part of the reason for categorizing things as wants is for you to physically see those things as non-necessities.
                    It can help you make the right, tough decisions.
                </p>

                </figure>
            </sidebyside>

               <p>
                    -Suppose you are over-spending in needs but not in other areas.
                    This is fairly common with the current cost of housing.
                    This scenario is tougher, and it is one reason why the 50-30-20 isn’t right for some people.
                    It may require you to make some big changes in your life.
                    Getting a roommate if rent is too high, carpooling to work to save on gas, re-housing a pet to a good home if pet 
                    supplies are burdensome, shopping around for better insurance rates, changing Internet providers are all examples 
                    changes that could help your needs spending down.
                </p> 

                <p>
                    -Suppose you are saving more than 20%of your income.
                    This may not be a bad thing if you are meeting your needs and feel satisfied with how many wants you’re able to fulfill.
                    However, if you are saving so much that you are not paying for your needs or are feeling unsatisfied with what wants you’re able to have, it may be ok to allow yourself to spend more.
                    Of course, depending on your savings goals, saving more than 20%may be a necessary part of the plan.
                </p>

                <p>
                    -If you find yourself over-spending on wants and under-saving, I highly recommend setting up automatic deposits or transfers into a long-term savings account that is separate from your spending/checking account.
                    This effective forces you to put part of your paycheck aside for savings and giving you a smaller amount to spend each month.

                -Pay-day loans.
                Pay-day loans are short-term, high-interest loans.
                For example, if you’re paychecks are usually $1,000 bi-weekly, the pay-day loan place may give you $900 now in exchange for your $1,000 coming in two weeks.
                Under that agreement, you are agreeing to a loan with 1448%interest.
                For context, a mortgage loan is currently around 6%.
                Here is the real evil about these places.
                People go to these places because they’re broke and need cash to pay bills immediately.
                Sacrificing a solid chunk of your paycheck often isn’t really manageable.
                For example, if you are unable to pay bills with your $1,000 biweekly checks, then how could you do it by giving a pay-day loan place $100 on top of your bills.
                Many people are able to payback their short-term loan with their paychecks.
                When this happens, they owe a pay-day loan company money under an extraordinarily-high interest rate that grows exponentially.
                What you owe becomes completely unmanageable within just a few weeks.
                Never take out a short-term cash loan (either from a pay-day loan place or a cash-advance on your credit card).
                Grab a casual job stocking shelves at a local grocer.
                Call your landlord and explain the situation to try to negotiate a short extension on rent.
                Sell something you’re not using much.
                Please don’t resort to a short-term cash loan.
            </p>

            <p>
                -Gambling and lottery.
                Just don’t gamble.
                We’ll discuss the psychology of gambling in a later week, but for now, just acknowledge that gambling is not a valid way to get cash you need to pay bills.
                You’ll just make your situation worse.

                    -Asking for a personal loan.  Here is a life lesson many people don't learn until it's too late.  
                    Never loan money to a friend or family unless you are fully prepared never to see that money again.  
                    Money complicates relationships.  On the borrower side, asking for financial help can put stress on a 
                    friendship or relationship.  A personal loan \textit{can} be a potential source of immediate relief with bills, 
                    but please reflect deeply on the situation first.  
                    It may be better if you look for ways to earn income rather than ask someone for a loan.

                -Debt consolidation.
                You have likely seen commercials for debt consolidation.
                These are for companies you essentially take on your various debts by paying them for you in exchange for regular payments from you.
                Debt consolidation <em>can</em> be an option if you have <em>a lot of high-interest debt</em>.
                In that case, you are effectively re-financing your debt at a lower rate.
                The issue is that many of the companies that advertise this service have predatory tactics.
                One common one is that in exchange for this service, they tack on a large “fee” to what you owe (on top of the interest they get from you).
                Another tactic is putting you on a variable interest rate in which you start with a low rate to them, but that rate grows over time.
                Another tactic is to advertise low monthly payments, but extend the length of those payments drastically.
                If you find yourself in a great deal of high-interest debt, research ways to lower the interest rate on what you owe.
                If you cannot refinance a loan, debt consolidation may be a resource.
                However, please research options carefully.
                In general, try to go through a local, trustworthy bank rather than a financial institution.

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-inconsistent">
            <title>Inconsistent Paychecks</title>
            <p>
                Many people do not have a set salary with near-identical paychecks each week.
                For example, people who operate their own small business may see different amounts of income month-to-month.
                Not being able to predict how much you’ll make in future months makes budgeting more challenging.
                Here are a few ideas to consider when building a budget.
            </p>

            <p>
                -If possible, try to determine an “average” or “typical” month in terms of income.
                If you can be fairly sure that, on average, you have a certain amount of money coming in, it is very possible to make a budget.
                The issue is that in months of higher-than-average income, you <em>have</em> to set the extra money aside as “income” in lower-than-average months.
                For example, suppose that you determined that, on average, you have $3,000 in income.
                Let’s say one month you earned $4,000.
                Then your income for the month is $3,000 that can be used for your needs, wants, and savings.
                The extra $1,000 is not income for that month.
                It is set aside, and when you have a month of lower income, say $2,200, you have that saved $1,000 to make up the shortfall.
                It takes more discipline, but it is definitely manageable.
            </p>

            <p>
                -Do not consider “bonuses” as part of your regular income.
                Some jobs pay bonuses at the end of the year.
                If you start to think of an expected bonus as part of your income, you may find yourself in a tricky situation when a bonus comes in lower than expected (or not at all).
            </p>

            <p>
                -Even with the best of planning, sometimes someone with inconsistent paychecks find themselves in a long drought of work or productivity.
                In a circumstance like this, you may want to consider a career change or be willing to do contract work like Uber or Task Rabbit.

            <p>
                We’ve mentioned “rainy-day” funds, but we haven’t really talked about them.
                A “rainy-day fund” is an easily-accessible pot of money that is used for unexpected expenses.
                Needing to pay for an unexpected large medical insurance deductible, a veterinary bill, or a car-repair bill are all examples of infrequent, unexpected costs that you don’t include explicitly in a monthly budget.
                A rainy-day fund is a fund to pay for these expenses.
                Some people refer to their rainy-day fund as a “cushion.”
            </p>

            <p>
                If you do not have funds available to pay for unexpected bills, you may end up going into debt, which will increase how much you spend each month in bills.
                It is not recommended to withdraw funds from long-term accounts like retirement accounts for unexpected bills.
                It is best if you have a separate account for a rainy-day fund.
            </p>

            <p>
                Generally, it is recommended that a rainy-day fund has about six months worth of necessary expenses.
                For example, if you determine that a normal month requires around $2,000 in “needs” like rent and food, then you should aim to have rainy-day fund of $12,000.
                The reasons for this high amount are many.
                If you lose your job, it can take months to find another one.
                Veterinary and car bills can range in the thousands of dollars.
                A lot of life can happen, and it can happen all at once.
            </p>

            <p>
                It is usually recommended that you start building a rainy-day fund before other kinds of savings.
                Certainly focus on a rainy-day fund over saving for a vacation.
                Of course, it is appropriate to put aside money in both a rainy-day fund and a long-term investment fund simultaneously.
            </p>

            <p>
                One important note is that many people think of a “rainy-day” fund and an “emergency” fund as separate.
                That is fine.
                They have the same function - they are both to pay for unexpected bills or costs.
                The main difference is the amounts in each.
                I just think of these as one “rainy-day” fund.

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-negotiating">
            <title>Negotiaing Expenses</title>
            <p>
                I was going to include this as a way to help balance your budget, but it is so important that it gets its own little subsection.
            </p>

            <p>
                Did you know you can negotiate some of your monthly bills?
            </p>

            <p>
                First, a little background on business in the US.
                If you ask your parents or grandparents about how much TV cable subscriptions used to be, you’ll find that the costs of these services has grown far more than any other cost in the US, including housing.
                Most of this rise in cost in nothing but pure profit to the companies.
                Have you ever wondered why Time-Warner and Comcost <alert>never</alert> provide service in the same area.
                (If you live in an area service by Comcast, have you even heard of Time-Warner? Or vice-versa?) That is because they have a back-door agreement not to compete with each other.
                By not competing, they do not need to compete for your business by offering competitive prices.
                If you’re thinking that this is a monopoly and shouldn’t be allowed, you’re half right.
                It’s called an “oligopoly,” which is perfectly legal in the US and forms the foundation of many industries like cable, phone providers, airlines, baby formula, and music.
                It’s all rather depressing.
                However, it means that for services like these, companies <em>can</em> offer you their services for much cheaper and still make a hefty profit.
            </p>

            <p>
                Here is a rule of life.
                If a company is willing to offer you a product of service at a certain price for a month or year, they can do so again for the next month/year.
                (Free-trials are not included.) If your cable company offers you an “introductory rate” for a year, they will be willing to offer it again the next year.
                Yes, there are exceptions, but it is a good rule to live by.
                A company would rather make some profit off of your rather than no profit.
            </p>

            <p>
                Here is how you do it.
                Simple call or text with a customer service representative and ask to renegotiate your service plan or you will cancel your service.
                Here are some basic tips.
            </p>

            <p>
                -If they refuse, continue with canceling.
                Even if it is something you know you really need/want to keep, continue with canceling.
                Often, if they see you’re not bluffing, you’ll get an offer for a lower rate.
                At worst, you actually do cancel your service.
                If so, learn to live without the service or simply restart the service.
                All that would be wasted is a few minutes of your life.
                (Note that there are some old “grandfathered” plans people have.
                You may hear some people talk about “YouTube Red” that they’ll never get rid of.
                I have an old grandfathered plan with T-Mobile that is much better than any other plan I could possibly get these days.
                Don’t give those up unless you actually want to get rid of the service.)
            </p>

            <p>
                -Never take the first offer unless its better than what you have.
                I just recently negotiated my XM radio subscription.
                It started at $21.99 per month.
                First offer was $17.99.
                Second was $7.09.
                Last was $4.09, which was my “introductory offer.” They won’t take an offer away once they’ve offered it to you.
            </p>

            <p>
                -Sometimes you can ask to be “treated as a new customer.” That is, ask to have access to introductory rate offered to non-existing customers.
            </p>

            <p>
                -You can sometimes negotiate a better interest rate on your credit cards, which lowers how much you need to pay each month on them (if you carry a balance).
                Keep in mind that this sometimes requires a hard credit check, which will lower your credit score.
                We’ll talk about credit in a later week.
            </p>

            <p>
                -Rent can be negotiated, to an extent.
                It never hurts to ask your landlord to negotiate rent.
                However, in a market such as this one, you’re unlikely to be successful as there will be someone willing and able to pay what you’re paying.
                On the other hand, you do not always need to put up with large rent hikes.
                If you find yourself in a situation in which your rent is suddenly increased massively, you may be able to fight it in <em>housing</em> court.
                (Not civil court.)
            </p>

            <p>
                Keep in mind that not all bills can be negotiated.
                Cable, phone, entertainment subscriptions, magazines, are examples of services that can be negotiated.
                Utilities, groceries, and other consumable products are generally not negotiable.

            <title>Activity: Helping Balance a Budget</title>
            <p>
                In preparation for this course, I’ve been scouring Reddit for questions and comments regarding budgeting.
                Below are some common questions or comments from people.
                For each, give some suggestions that could be of use to the person.
            </p>

            <p>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            “How is it even possible to save money when half of it goes just to my rent?”
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            “Every time I try to budget, I can never get the numbers to add up.
                            I always end up giving up on it.”
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            “How do you even not spend your whole paycheck? I mean, if I have the cash for Uber Eats, then how am I going to be cooking after work every night?”
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            “How am I supposed to budget when I have to predict how much I’m going to spend? How am I supposed to know whether I’m going to spend $200 or $1,000 on groceries next month?”

        <title>Budgeting Tools</title>
        <p>
            Budgeting doesn't have to be with just a notepad and a pencil.  There are some great resources to help create a clean and understandable budget.
        </p>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-paper-tools">
            <title>Paper Tools</title>
            <p>
                For many people, the act of physically writing something can make it more concrete and real.
                If you are one of those people, doing your budget on paper may be the way to go.
                At the end of this section, I’ve included a possible monthly budget worksheet that I’ve created.
                It is one of many possible templates out there.
                Feel free to print it out if you’d like.
            </p>

            <p>
                A paper budget is fairly easy in concept.
                In the respective areas, write down your usual expenses in a month.
                Don’t include infrequent things like getting a tire repaired.
                Of course, you can include a “miscellaneous” in either needs or wants (or both).
                Ultimately, you need to make sure that your expenses, including savings, are no more than your total income for a month.
                If they are higher, you immediately know that you need to examine your expenses and make some changes.
                Once you’ve made sure you can afford your proposed month, you should make sure your budget falls in line with your savings goals.
                Whether it be the 20%or something different, ask yourself if you’re putting enough away for what you want to achieve.
                If not, you may need to make some changes to get your savings component higher.
            </p>

            <p>
                The downside to a paper budget is that they are not very secure and it is harder to keep a record of them.
            </p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-spreadsheets">
            <title>Spreadsheets</title>
            <p>
                As more people brought personal computers into their homes, budgeting on spreadsheets became very common.
                Any spreadsheet program works.
                There are even some programs available targeted specifically for budgeting, usually at a cost.
                I’m using “program” here rather than “app” to include hard-drive bound applications and locally-saved files.
                I understand that the term “program” is falling out of use.
                I am partial to Excel as my program of choice, which you can download for free as a Westfield State student.
            </p>

            <p>
                The nice thing about spreadsheets is that you can “program” them to automatically add-up totals, find percentages, or find differences (among other things).
                You can also simply type in numbers and calculate what you need to by hand.
                Ultimately, the process is the same as if you were working on paper.
                One big benefit is that you can download a spreadsheet file of all your purchases in a month from your credit card account or withdrawals from your bank account and paste them right into your spreadsheet.
                If you browse Reddit for a while, you’ll find most long-term budget users use spreadsheets over a fancy app.
            </p>

            <p>
                The downside of spreadsheet programs is the learning curve to some of them.
                You may need a working knowledge of your program of choice before you can really use them.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have uploaded two files on Plato for you to look at.
                One is a blank budget template that you free to use.
                The other is a simple example what a budget could look like.
            </p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-apps">
            <title>Apps</title>
            <p>
                The popularity of budgeting apps has been skyrocketing over the past number of years.
                They can be as simple or complex as you like.
                Some even connect to your bank, credit cards, and utilities accounts to automatically update values and make recommendations.
                One benefit to an app is that for people who do not have the discipline to stick with a spreadsheet month-to-month, an app can make the process more inviting, colorful, and efficient.
            </p>

            <p>
                Before progressing, a word of caution.
                As with everything in our connected world, access to services usually comes with security issues.
                Different apps collect different amounts of your private information.
                Before downloading any app or connecting something to one of your accounts, do some research into what information is collected and how it is stored and used.
                Only use a service in which you are comfortable with its information policies.
                Below, I give a couple of examples of popular budgeting apps.
                I don’t have a recommendation, and I do not make any claims to their information security policies.
                This is all informational stuff.
            </p>

            <p>
                Here is another word of warning, and a life lesson.
                You’ll notice that most popular budgeting apps are not free, or they have very limited free versions that are barely useful.
                You’ll also see a price tag well beyond what they’re worth.
                (As in $10-$20 a month.) Here is why.
                The target audience of these apps are people who either are new to personal finance or have a history of poor budgeting habits.
                These companies are hoping to capitalize on this inexperience or lack of confidence.
                You have to ask yourself if the polish and extra features of a paid app are worth $100-$200 a year for you.
            </p>

            <p>
                -Goodbudget.
                Goodbudget uses the envelope method of budgeting.
                There is a “free” version that limits you to 10 “envelopes” (plus 10 miscellaneous envelopes) and does not connect to your bank.
                The paid version is either $10 a month or $80 a year.
                Essentially, you tell Goodbudget how much your paychecks are.
                You then set up virtual “envelopes” to allocate money.
                You can also tell it how much debt you have and how you are paying it off (like car loans or credit cards).
                Goodbudget is more about planning for your next month than it is reflecting on your past expenses.
                So, if you are looking for insight on why last month’s budget went awry, Goodbudget may not be the best option.
                The app also has no way of telling when you overspend from an envelope.
                If you budgeted $250 for groceries but spent $300, you’ll need to update that manually.
                If you need some help planning and have the discipline to manually enter and keep track of your expenses, Goodbudget may work.
            </p>

            <p>
                -YNAB.
                (Used to be “You Need A Budget.” Not it’s “Why-Nab.”) YNAB might be the most polished, and expensive, app available.
                It is $15 per month or $110 per year.
                Much of your money goes toward the polish, but that is important for some people.
                YNAB connects to most bank accounts.
                If you use your debit card or direct pay for most expenses, YNAB can automatically determine what category each expense falls into.
                YNAB uses the zero-balance budget method, which asks you to spend or save every dollar of income.
                It also comes with a bunch of pretty graphs, if that sort of thing excites you.
                College students can get a one-year “free” trial of YNAB.
                (“Free” in that you still need to give it billing information that will automatically kick in unless you jump through the hoops to delete your account.) The big claim to YNAB are the educational resources.
                It gives suggestions on how to allocate your money.
                (A fancier version of the 50-30-20 rule.)
            </p>

            <p>
                -PocketGuard.
                First, PocketGuard costs $75 per year.
                PocketGuard is a bit different.
                It is designed more around lowering expenses first and then budgeting afterward.
                It claims to help detect unnecessary subscriptions and will “negotiate” with certain companies for better rates.
                (E.g., a better monthly rate for Internet.) It connects to most of your financial accounts including your bank, credit cards, loan providers, etc.
                The budgeting aspect is fairly basic.
                After your automatic monthly expenses are deducted, you build your budget manually around it.
                It can auto-categorize expenses from your bank or credit card statements.
                <alert>I do NOT recommend “trying” PocketGuard to see if it lowers your bills.
                You will be charged $75 and locked into a subscription whether or not it actually does what it claims.</alert>
            </p>

            <p>
                Again, <alert>please be careful with these apps</alert>.
                Whether it be becoming locked into a paid subscription or giving access to your financial information, these apps exist for the companies’ benefit.
                Your benefit is secondary to them.
                Do research and make informed decisions.
            </p>

                <p>
                    Does a budget like the 50-30-20 budget apply to students?
                </p>

                <p>
                    A budget plan is simply a guide for how to manage money and are not concrete things.
                    Numbers can be changed to adapt to certain situations.
                    Some students choose to work just enough to pay for college expenses, and that’s ok.
                    A budget is meant to help you gain and maintain financial stability.
                    If you’re in a situation where you still have most of your expenses paid for by your parents, then the numbers involved may look different.
                    Perhaps you could save more than 20% of money you earn?

            <li>
                <p>
                    Do I need to spend 50%of my money on needs?
                </p>

                <p>
                    No.
                    First, a budget is simply a tool for helping you achieve and maintain financial health.
                    It is not a law of the world.
                    Think of the 50-30-20 rule more as a guideline in which you should aim so that no more than 50% of your income goes to needs and no more than 30% goes to wants.

                <p>
                    How do taxes play a role in budgeting.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For the majority of people in the US, taxes are taken out of your paycheck automatically.
                    So, you do not need to budget for taxes.
                    You base your budget on your after-tax or take-home amount.
                    So, after your taxes have been removed, you build your budget around what you get post-taxes.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>
                    Should I learn how to avoid taxes?
                </p>

                <p>
                    No.
                    That’s called “tax evasion.” Taxes pay for education, roads, law enforcement, parks, sanitation, etc.
                    Taxes are necessary for maintaining the benefits of living in a country like the US.
                    There are legitimate ways to reduce what you pay in taxes, which we’ll cover in a later week.
                </p>

            <li>
                <p>
                    How does insurance play a role in budgeting?
                </p>

                <p>
                    For most types of insurance, you factor insurance into your budget as a need.
                    The tricky one is medical insurance.
                    If you get medical insurance through your employer, you likely pay a part of the premium (usually 25%) out of your paycheck automatically.
                    You have a choice with this.
                    If possible, you could think of that automatic insurance premium payment like a tax and use your post-tax, post-insurance pay for budgeting.
                    However, you can also include the premium payment as a need.
                    In that case, you would need to add what you pay in insurance premium to your after-tax pay amount and then build your budget, including medical insurance as a need.
                    For example, if your after-tax pay is $2,000 each month and insurance is $200 each month (making your paychecks total $1,800), you could take $1,800 as your money used for budgeting, basing percentages off $1,800 and not including medical insurance in the budget.
                    You could also take $2,000 as your pay (even though you only get paychecks totaling $1,800) and base percentages off that, but you need to make sure that the $200 is listed as a need in your budget.

                <p>
                    How do I stop my bank account from going negative?
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you can, pretend that $0 isn’t a balance of $0.
                    Make a mental note that some amount, say $100, is effectively $0.
                    That is, if you see your account approaching $100, you tell yourself you are out of money and can no longer spend until you have more.
                    The more you earn/spend as life goes on, you’ll want that minimum number to be higher.
                    Note that this minimum amount is different than a rainy-day or emergency fund.

                    How do I get rich by making a budget?
                </p>

                <p>
                    A budget isn’t about accumulating wealth.
                    It is about getting and maintaining financial health.
                    The savings component of a budget will help with accumulating long-term savings or retirement, but it is not a way to get rich quick.
                    However, sticking to a budget can help you get rich slow and steady, or at least help lift yourself out of poverty.

                    There are some things I label as wants, but I can’t go a day without them.
                    What should I do?
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you find yourself in a situation where you need to cut back on wants but your brain is really driving you to keep buying a certain thing, you may be looking at an addiction.
                    It may be worth talking with someone at the Counseling Center about getting some tips to cut back.

                            For this exercise, you will make your own monthly budget.
                            First, <alert>list out all our expenses and savings and classify them as needs, wants, and savings</alert>.
                            If there are any items you want to keep personal and don’t want me to see, just list it as “personal expense,” but still give the actual monthly amount that personal item costs.
                            Second, <alert>create your budget using whatever budget plan and technique you’d like, except for an app.</alert> (You may still use an app to budget, but in terms of submitting your budget for this assignment, an app would be a bit tedious.)
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            You have two options.
                            If you have a job, either full-time or part-time, and have some of your own expenses that you pay for, you can use your actual paychecks and expenses to create your budget.
                            If you do not currently work, you may create a hypothetical budget using income and expenses you might expect shortly after graduation.
                            (If you do this hypothetical budget, research how much the starting pay is for a job you could see yourself doing just after graduation.
                            Don’t use “average pay.” Also research realistic expenses in terms of housing, food, etc.
                            For your pay, take how much is reported for a starting pay and multiply by 0.7.
                            This will give you an approximate after-tax amount.)
