    <title>Week 2: Introduction, Money Psychology, and Setting Financial Goals</title>
    <p>
        Welcome to our second week of Money and You!  In this week, we will explore budgets.  A budget is simply a plan for how you will 
        spend your money over a certain time period.

        <title>Do You Need a Budget?</title>
        <p>
            Yes.  Yes you do.

            <p>
                Every part of our capitalist society is devoted to trying to get your to spend your money.  Our society makes it really easy 
                for you to buy products or services with little to no thought.  One of the biggest reasons people go into debt or are 
                unable to ever retire is because they overspend their paychecks.

        <p>
            And it's really easy to overspend.  Don't have enough in your bank account for that manicure?  Credit card.  Need a flashier 
            car?  Payment plan.  Need a bit of spending cash for the holidays?  Cash advance.  (These are not advice for these scenarios.  
            Please don't do them.  They're just examples of how easier it is the spend money you don't have.)  A budget can be a tool that 
            can help teach you discipline and fiscal responsibility.  A budget is essentially the backbone or core of financial well-being.  
            It is the foundation upon which other financial skills will be built.
        </p>

        <p>
            A budget will help track where your money goes.  Setting a budget for the first time can be quite eye-opening.  
            Most people find that they spend far more on certain things than they think.  A budget will help you set and achieve 
            STAR goals.  By putting goals into your budget, you are better set for reaching them.  A budget can help payoff your 
            debts or help prevent falling into debt.  Debt is expensive, and it generally isn't good to fall into unmanageable debt.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now, I'll tell you the truth.  I do not currently set a budget for myself.  I used to, but after getting an intuitive 
            sense of how much I can spend and save each paycheck, I can confidently go through each month without overspending and 
            managing to have an emergency fund for unplanned expenses.  This is not because I'm wealthy.  I'm the lowest paid 
            associate professor in the Massachusetts state college system.  This is because I set a strict budget for myself that 
            I followed until it became habit.  When people say they can live comfortably, this scenario is usually what they mean.  
            For most, it doesn't happen overnight.  It takes time.

        <title>Budgeting Rules</title>
        <p>
            In this section, we'll explore a few popular budgeting rules.  There are general strategies for planning to spend your paychecks.  
            Not all rules will fit everyone's situation, so it can take some trial-and-error to find one that works for you.

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-50-30-20">
            <title>The 50-30-20 Rule</title>
            <sidebyside widths="40% 50%" margins="0% 0%" valign="middle">
                <p>
                    Here is the rule.  Your <em>>after-tax income</em> (``take-home pay'') should be allocated so that 50% is spent on ``needs,'' 
                    30% is spent on ``wants,'' and 20% is saved.  That's it.  Let's break down these three categories.
                </p>

            </sidebyside>

            <p>
                <term>Needs</term> - A <em>need</em> is a necessity that you cannot do without.  Housing, utilities, food, supplies, 
                insurance, clothing, and transportation are examples of things considered necessities.  Other things can definitely be 
                considered ``needs,'' based on your individual situation.  
            </p>

            <p>
                <term>Wants</term> - A <em>want</em> is something that you would like to have but isn't strictly necessary for your 
                survival.  Eating out, entertainment, coffee, luxury items, and cosmetics are examples of things considered wants.
            </p>

            <p>
                <term>Savings</term> - A <em>savings</em> item is simply an account in which you put money you do not spend that can be used 
                for the future.  Retirement accounts, savings accounts, and swear jars are all examples of things considered to be savings 
                items.
            </p>

            <p>
                Sounds simple, right?  Here is one of the biggest barriers to the 50-30-20 rule.  Most people are reluctant to label 
                some desirable items as a ``want.''  Thinking to yourself, ``I couldn't live without coffee,'' doesn't make it a need.  
                If you live where there is robust public transportation, owning a car may not be considered a need.  Pet supplies are 
                tricky.  Is owning a pet a necessity?  Most people with pets are hesitant to say no.  What about Internet access?  It 
                may be a necessity, but is the highest speed possible a necessity?  
            </p>

                <p>
                    Here is an important truth.  <em>If the thought of not having something makes you uncomfortable, that doesn't make 
                    the thing automatically a necessity.</em>

                Here some examples of things I've heard from people in my life this particular week (at the time I wrote this section):
            </p>
            <sidebyside widths="40% 50%" margins="0% 0%" valign="middle">

                        <li>
                            <p>
                                ``I just need Taco Bell for my mental health.  It's my comfort food.''
                            </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>
                                ``I couldn't survive without Door Dash.''
                            </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>
                                ``We can't live anywhere that won't allow the `sweets.'"  (``Sweets'' are her cats.  For context, they've been 
                                without housing for a year, and this was in response to an opportunity to get into an affordable place.)
                            </p>
                        </li>

            <title>Activity: Classifying Spending</title>
            <p>
                Let's practice categorizing things as needs, wants, or savings.  For each item/scenario, classify each as a need, a want, 
                or savings.  Pick only one.  For each, explain your answer in one sentence.
