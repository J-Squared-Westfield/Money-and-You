    <title>Week 2: Introduction, Money Psychology, and Setting Financial Goals</title>
    <p>
        Welcome to our second week of Money and You!  In this week, we will explore budgets.  A budget is simply a plan for how you will 
        spend your money over a certain time period.

                Every part of our capitalist society is devoted to trying to get your to spend your money.  Our society makes it really easy 
                for you to buy products or services with little to no thought.  One of the biggest reasons people go into debt or are 
                unable to ever retire is because they overspend their paychecks.

            And it's really easy to overspend.  Don't have enough in your bank account for that manicure?  Credit card.  Need a flashier 
            car?  Payment plan.  Need a bit of spending cash for the holidays?  Cash advance.  (These are not advice for these scenarios.  
            Please don't do them.  They're just examples of how easier it is the spend money you don't have.)  A budget can be a tool that 
            can help teach you discipline and fiscal responsibility.  A budget is essentially the backbone or core of financial well-being.  
            It is the foundation upon which other financial skills will be built.

            A budget will help track where your money goes.  Setting a budget for the first time can be quite eye-opening.  
            Most people find that they spend far more on certain things than they think.  A budget will help you set and achieve 
            STAR goals.  By putting goals into your budget, you are better set for reaching them.  A budget can help payoff your 
            debts or help prevent falling into debt.  Debt is expensive, and it generally isn't good to fall into unmanageable debt.

            Now, I'll tell you the truth.  I do not currently set a budget for myself.  I used to, but after getting an intuitive 
            sense of how much I can spend and save each paycheck, I can confidently go through each month without overspending and 
            managing to have an emergency fund for unplanned expenses.  This is not because I'm wealthy.  I'm the lowest paid 
            associate professor in the Massachusetts state college system.  This is because I set a strict budget for myself that 
            I followed until it became habit.  When people say they can live comfortably, this scenario is usually what they mean.  
            For most, it doesn't happen overnight.  It takes time.

        <title>Budgeting Rules</title>
        <p>
            In this section, we'll explore a few popular budgeting rules.  There are general strategies for planning to spend your paychecks.  
            Not all rules will fit everyone's situation, so it can take some trial-and-error to find one that works for you.
