        In this week, we'll look at risk from a non-investment point of view and build an understanding of the how's and why's of insurances.

            Have you ever been in a situation where you are inclined to say, “What are the chances of this?!” The funny thing about coincidences is that they aren’t are unlikely as you think.
            One of the most important, but misunderstood, aspects of life is the nature of randomness and probability.
            In this section, we’ll be considering why unlikely coincidences and events aren’t really “unlikely.”

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-The-Birthday-Problem">
            <title>The Birthday Problem</title>
            <p>
                One common coincidence that people experience is running into someone with the same birthday.
                Let’s briefly exam how common or uncommon this is.
            </p>

            <p>
                Suppose there are a number of people in a room.
                What is the probability that <em>at least two people</em> share a birthday?
            </p>

            <p>
                Notice that this question is difference than, “what is the probability that someone has your birthday?” We are just asking if there are some people in the group that share a birthday.
                It turns our that this question is more easily answered by asking the opposite question.
                Instead we ask, “what is the probability that <em>no one</em> shares a birthday with anyone else?” The reason why is it is easier to examine this question mathematically.
            </p>

            <p>
                We won’t go over the mathematics in full, but we’ll explore a bit.
                Let’s suppose that 3 people come into a room one-by-one.
                Let’s also suppose (for simplicity) that February 29th birthdays aren’t a thing and that birthdays are evenly distributed over a whole year.
                The first person walks into the room followed by the second.
                What is the probability that person number 2 does not have the same birthday as person 1? It is <m>\frac{364}{365}\approx 99.73\%</m>.
                Now the third person walks in.
                What is the probability that that person does not share a birthday with either person 1 or person 2? It would be <m>\frac{363}{365}\approx 99.45\%</m>.
                (Because there are 363 other days in the year that are not the birthdays of persons 1 or 2.)
            </p>

            <p>
                Now here is the important bit.
                What is the probability that all three have different birthdays? We calculate it as a process.
                First, person 2 has a different birthday than person 1.
                Then, person 3 has a different birthday than person 2.
                The probability is calculated as the product of those two events: <m>\frac{364}{365}\times \frac{363}{365}\approx 99.12\%</m>.
                So, it’s very likely that the three people have different birthdays.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now what if we increase the number of people? If we add a fourth person, the probability that none of the four people share a birthday with someone else in the group is: <m>\frac{364}{365}\times \frac{363}{365}\times\frac{362}{365}\approx 98.36\%</m>.
                So, if there is a group of four people, there is a <m>100\% - 98.36\% = 1.64\%</m> chance that at least two people share a birthday.
            </p>

            <p>
                We can keep going:
            </p>

            <p>
                5 people in a group: 2.71%chance of a shared birthday.
            </p>

            <p>
                6 people in a group: 4.05%chance of a shared birthday.
            </p>

            <p>
                7 people in a group: 5.62%chance of a shared birthday.
            </p>

            <p>
                8 people in a group: 7.43%chance of a shared birthday.
            </p>

            <p>
                Notice that the chances of a shared birthday is growing with the number of people.
                Also notice that the chance is growing faster and faster.
                This is the important observation.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now, if you have 23 people in the group, if you do the math, you’ll get that there is a 50.73%chance that there is a shared birthday in a group.
                That means that when there are 23 people in a group, it is actually more likely that at least two people share a birthday than it is that everyone has different birthdays! (This does <alert>not</alert> means that it is more likely that someone has <em>your</em> birthday than not.
                It means that it is more likely that there are some people who share a birthday.) That mathematical fact is not obvious, bit it is important.
                If you were sitting in a class with at least 23 students, do you intuitively believe that it is likely that some people in the room share a birthday? Probably not, but it is true.
            </p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-The-Probability-Something-Happens">
            <title>The Probability-that-Something-Happens</title>
            <p>
                Here is the important takeaway from the birthday problem.
                It is indeed unlikely that when two people meet that they have the same birthday.
                However, when there is a group of people, there are a lot of “chances” for there to be a shared birthday.
                With each person, the likelihood that no one has a shared birthday gets smaller and smaller, making the likelihood of some shared birthday higher and higher.
            </p>

            <p>
                Let’s consider another type of problem.
                Suppose the WSU SGA is holding an event in which there are three games to play.
                For each game, only 20%of people win.
                How likely is it that you win at least one of the games?
            </p>

            <p>
                Again, it is mathematically easier to find the probability that you do not win <em>any</em> of the games.
                For each game, there is an 80%chance that you’ll lose.
                The probability that you lose all three would be <m>0.8 \time 0.8 \time 0.8 = 0.512</m> or 51.2%.
                This means there is a 48.8%chance that you’ll win at least once.
                Were you expecting that probability to be that high?
            </p>

            <p>
                What we are doing here is not looking at one event happening on its own.
                Instead, we are looking at all possible events at once and asking what is the likelihood that at least one of the possible things happen.
                Or rather, what is the likelihood that none of the events happen? Or even, what is the likelihood that no coincidences happen? The more possibilities for <em>some</em> coincidence to happen, the more likely that something will happen.
            </p>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Why-It-Matters">
            <title>Why It Matters</title>
            <p>
                Here is some good news.
                You probably will not die from heart disease.
                About 20.1%of Americans die from heart disease, which means 79.9%do not.
                You probably won’t die from cancer.
                About 19%of Americans will die from cancer.
                So, about 81%of Americans do not die from cancer.
                You probably won’t die from an unintentional injury like falling or getting in a car accident.
                About 7%of Americans die from accidents, which means 93%of Americans do not die from accidents.
                You probably won’t die from a stroke.
                About 5.3%of American die from a stroke, meaning 94.7%of Americans do not.
            </p>

            <p>
                Here is the bad news.
                If we ask, what is the probability that you won’t die from heart disease, cancer, an accident, or a stroke, the probability because <m>0.799 \times 0.81 \time 0.93 \time 0.947 \approx 0.57</m> or 57%.
                This means there is a 43%chance that you will die from one of those causes, which is very high.
                To make matters worse, if you are wondering what the probability is of simply passing on in your sleep without disease or disfunction, it’s really, really small.
                (Please note that there are a lot of other factors that contribute to these proababilities.
                So, these figures likely do not apply exactly to you individually.)
            </p>

            <p>
                Here is the point to take away.
                Individually, the likelihood of one particular thing happening may be small.
                However, the probability that at least one bad thing happening gets quite large.
            </p>

            <p>
                It is all about risk exposure.
                Take today as an example.
                Today, it is very unlikely that you’ll experience something that will require you to get emergency medical care (poisoning, injury, disease, etc.) Tomorrow, it will be just as unlikely.
                But what about <em>some</em> day in the next year? The likelihood that you will need emergency medical care at some point in the next year is substantially higher than the likelihood that you will need it on one particular day.

        <title>Insurance</title>
        <subsection xml:id="subsec-What-Is-Insurance">
            <title>What Is Insurance?</title>
            <p>
                We’ve already examined one big insurance program: Social Security.
                We’ve never discussed what insurance actually is.
                Insurance is an agreement of sorts.
                Someone who is exposed to a certain risk of something bad happening may want the security of being able to survive or afford getting through that bad thing, should it happen.
                Suppose, for example, someone is concerned that their car may be stolen one day.
                They may want some kind of protection financially should their care actually get stolen.
                Insurance is a way for this security to happen.
            </p>

            <p>
                A person or company may be willing the help someone get through a certain negative experience in exchange for money.
                That is, for example, perhaps some company is willing to reimburse the person if their car were actually stolen.
                The risk of a stolen car gets moved from the person to the company.
                The company would not take on this risk for free though.
                The person would need to pay the company compensation for taking on the risk.
                This is essentially how insurance works at its most basic.
            </p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-How-Insurance-Works">
            <title>How Insurance Works</title>
            <p>
                When you are concerned about the possibility of a bad event (getting injured, your car gets damaged, your house burns down, etc.), you may want to protect yourself financially from these events.
                For example, maybe you want to protect yourself from needing to pay a medical bill or needing to fix your car or needing to rebuild your house.
                For many of these possible bad events, an <alert>insurance provider</alert> may be willing to take on your financial obligations should something bad occur in exchange for compensation.
                This financial compensation is usually through regular payments called <alert>premiums</alert>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Let’s take a house as an example.
                Suppose that you own a house that would cost $300,000 to rebuild or replace.
                You likely don’t have that money and wouldn’t be able to take out another loan to rebuild your house, should something happen.
                You could protect yourself from that scenario by setting up an <alert>insurance policy</alert> with a provider.
                They may charge you something in the range of $500-$900 for a premium per month to take on the finances of rebuilding your home.
                That sounds like a lot of money to pay each month, but it depends on how much you value protection.
            </p>

            <p>
                Once you have a policy in place, you are <alert>covered</alert> by your insurance provider in the event that a <alert>covered</alert> event happens.
                For example, more house insurance policy will cover damage from accidental fire, but they won’t cover fire damage if you purposely set your house on fire.
                When a covered event happens, you get in contact with your insurance company to <alert>file a claim</alert>.
                Over a bit of time, the insurance company will either give you a check for you to use to pay for bills and other expenses related to the event or pay the various service providers directly.
            </p>

            <p>
                Theoretically, any “bad” event in life could be covered by some insurance policy.
                The big ones are medical issues, automobile issues, building issues, early death, and property loss.
                However, you can get insurance on things like weather delaying your plane flight, alien abductions, and someone not showing up to their wedding.
            </p>

            <p>
                The important thing about insurance is that you need to have a policy with a provider <alert>before</alert> a bad event happens, never after.
                In some respects, insurance is a form of cost sharing.
                Multiple people pay premiums for their insurance coverage, and those premiums are used to pay for any covered losses or events that anyone in that pool experiences.
                However, to get the benefits of this cost sharing, you need to contribution your own premiums before something bad happens.
            </p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Mandatory-Insurance">
            <title>Mandatory Insurance</title>
            <p>
                In some instances, whether or not you want to take on the risk of paying for a bad event, you may be required legally to carry certain insurance policies.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you own a car in Massachusetts and want to legally drive it, you are required to carry a certain kind of insurance.
                If you are responsible for a car accident, you would be required to pay for repairing or replacing the other person’s car.
                You will also likely have some injury, and you would be responsible for paying for those medical expenses (up to a certain amount).
                You are required to carry insurance that would cover those expenses.
                This required insurance can make owning a car really expensive.
                The rationale for this requirement is that most people cannot pay for the expenses relating to an accident when they cause one.
                It is also expensive and difficult for the victim in the accident to get any sort of payment from the “at-fault” driver.
                While it may seem like this required insurance is an unnecessary expense that protects others, as a whole group, you are just as protected with every else’s insurance policies.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you take out a loan to purchase something, often a house or car, the lending bank will almost certainly require you to carry insurance that will completely replace the thing should anything happen.
                So, if you want to take out a mortgage for a house, you’ll be required to carry insurance on the house.
                If you take out a loan for a car, you’ll need to carry additional insurance that will replace or repair your car should it get damaged or stolen.
                The purpose here is for lenders to protect the collateral on the loans.
                The items you buy with the loaned money serve has collateral for the loan.
                The bank wants to maintain that collateral.
                Again, it appears that this kind of insurance is something to benefit the banks and not you.
                Keep in mind that if this requirement were not part of loans, the loans themselves would be much more expensive each month.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Affordable Care Act brings a requirement that every citizen have a certain level of “coverage” for medical expenses.
                The actual requirements are long and complicated, but just understand that every citizen is required to have some level of medial insurance.
                The penalty for not having adequate coverage is a tax penalty.
                However, it is easy to avoid this penalty by stating that you have a religious exemption to insurance coverage.
                One of the main rationales for this law is to make everyone part of the “cost sharing” in medical insurance.
                Again, it’s the situation in which if you only think of your medical issues in isolation or a vacuum, the requirement seems like a punishment, but if you consider the financial effects through cost sharing, you can see the benefit you get.

    <section xml:id="sec-Properties-of-Insurance">
        <title>Properties of Insurance</title>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, insurance is rarely as easy as buy policy, have accident, get accident paid for.
            There are a number of different characteristics to policies that affect how money is exchanged.
            We’ll go over the most common ones.
        </p>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Deductibles">
            <title>Deductibles</title>
            <p>
                If your insurance policy has a <alert>deducible</alert>, it means that the insurance provider will only pay for a bad event after you’ve paid a certain amount.
                For example, suppose you have a medical policy in which there is a $1,000 deductible applied each year.
                This means that before the medical insurance will pay for any of your medical expenses, you’ll need to pay $1,000 of your own money first.
                For example, suppose your medical insurance has a $1,000 deductible.
                Suppose that you get sick and need to visit your doctor, who charges $300 per visit.
                You would pay that $300.
                Now suppose that sometime later you fall and break your leg.
                The process of getting x-rays and a cast cost $4,000.
                You would pay the first $700 since that is the remaining balance on your deductible.
                insurance would cover the rest.
                All other expenses will be covered by insurance.
            </p>

            <p>
                Keep in mind that in the above scenario, you wouldn’t like need to pay that first $300.
                Due to the Affordable Care Act, things like visits to a doctor can be held liable to deductibles.
                However, the idea outlined above is how deductibles work mathematically.
            </p>

            <p>
                So, why do deductibles exist? The benefit to you are lower monthly premiums.
                Deductibles mean less risk for the insurance company, which means they’ll require less in premiums each month to take on the risks.
                It also has to do with the cost to process claims.
                Suppose you notice that your car has a really feint surface scratch on it that you could easily buff out for about $10.
                If you had an insurance policy for your car with no deductible, you could choose to take your car to an autobody shop to have the scratch repaired and have insurance pay for it.
                Not only would they need to pay the autobody shop (likely around $200), they also need to pay the employees who actually handle claims like this.
                It’s expensive.
                So, such an insurance policy would require much higher premiums compared to one with a deductible.
            </p>

            <p>
                Deductibles aren’t mandatory.
                Many insurance companies have policies with no deductibles.
                You might be shocked at how much more expensive no-deductible policies are.
            </p>
