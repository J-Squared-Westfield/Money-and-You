        <title>Welcome to Money and You!</title>
        <p> Welcome to Money and You!

            I am thrilled that you are part of my course.  I hope that this course will end up being one of your most useful in your undergraduate curriculum.  
            Understanding personal finance and how you think and act about money can benefit you in a number of ways.
        </p>

        <p>
            Money and You is a twist on a traditional personal finance course.  Over the semester, you will learn the fundamentals of managing your money, 
            which you will be able to use for the rest of your life.  You will learn techniques for setting a budget; why and how to build credit; the process, 
            benefits, and drawbacks of buying a home; the world of insurance; taxes as they apply to you; loans and debt; car-buying; scams; saving for 
            retirement; using modern finance tools; and setting financial goals.
        </p>

        <p>
            The twist on this course is the opportunity to reflect on how you (individually) behave around and think about money.  You will develop techniques 
            to manage stress about money, explore how money can affect your relationships, reflect on why you want certain things, explore your feelings about 
            risk and reward, and consider why long-term financial goals can be difficult without the proper mindset.

            <title>What this course is not</title>
            <p>
                This course is not a ``how to get rich quickly" lesson.  It is more of a ``how to accumulate wealth slowly" course.  Let's just get 
                this out of the way now.  If there were a proven track to move into the upper class, it wouldn't be some secret that is easily 
                divulged in a self-help book or class.  The course is about setting and achieving <em>realistic and manageable</em> financial goals.
            </p>

            <p>  
                This course is not a course on investment techniques.  We will cover how to save for retirement, which can involve investing, but 
                we will not explore specific investment strategies like picking particular stocks or trying to predict the crypto market.  We will 
                explore what finance experts do with their own money and why.  We will explore general strategies for saving.  We will not make any 
                speculations or bets on particular investment opportunities.
