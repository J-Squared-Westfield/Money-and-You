  <title>Week 1: Introduction, Money Psychology, and Setting Financial Goals</title>

    <section xml:id="welcome" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">
        <title>Welcome to Money and You!</title>
        <p> Welcome to Money and You!

            I am thrilled that you are part of my course.  I hope that this course will end up being one of your most useful in your undergraduate curriculum.  
            Understanding personal finance and how you think and act about money can benefit you in a number of ways.
        </p>

        <p>
            Money and You is a twist on a traditional personal finance course.  Over the semester, you will learn the fundamentals of managing your money, 
            which you will be able to use for the rest of your life.  You will learn techniques for setting a budget; why and how to build credit; the process, 
            benefits, and drawbacks of buying a home; the world of insurance; taxes as they apply to you; loans and debt; car-buying; scams; saving for 
            retirement; using modern finance tools; and setting financial goals.
        </p>

        <p>
            The twist on this course is the opportunity to reflect on how you (individually) behave around and think about money.  You will develop techniques 
            to manage stress about money, explore how money can affect your relationships, reflect on why you want certain things, explore your feelings about 
            risk and reward, and consider why long-term financial goals can be difficult without the proper mindset.

                    This course is not a ``how to get rich quickly" lesson.  It is more of a ``how to accumulate wealth slowly" course.  Let's just get 
                    this out of the way now.  If there were a proven track to move into the upper class, it wouldn't be some secret that is easily 
                    divulged in a self-help book or class.  The course is about setting and achieving <em>realistic and manageable</em> financial goals.

            <p>  
                This course is not a course on investment techniques.  We will cover how to save for retirement, which can involve investing, but 
                we will not explore specific investment strategies like picking particular stocks or trying to predict the crypto market.  We will 
                explore what finance experts do with their own money and why.  We will explore general strategies for saving.  We will not make any 
                speculations or bets on particular investment opportunities.

                Cards on the table, I am a professor of mathematics.  However, this course is not a mathematics course.  Of course, there will be 
                numbers since money is a quantitative object.  You will not need to memorize complex formulas.  You will need to be able to 
                understand some arithmetic and how to apply arithmetic in the context of some applied problems, but you will have access to pretty 
                much all computational tools you would like.

                    First and foremost, everyone should feel welcome and included in this class.  Each of us comes into this class with different 
                    experiences, identities, ideas, and social positions.  You can expect of me to foster an environment in which you can reach 
                    your academic goals.  I will expect of you, in-turn, to participate in that learning environment and contribute positively to 
                    other's learning.  Contributing positively to the learning environment means the following expectations (among others):
                </p>
            </sidebyside>

            <p>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Everyone is allowed to exist as themselves.  Harassing, dismissive, violent, disrespectful, or discriminatory 
                            rhetoric/behavior is not allowed.  You are allowed to be who you are.  Give that same freedom to others.  It is ok to 
                            disagree.  It is not ok make someone else feel less valuable.  I reserve the right to request students who engage in 
                            such behavior be removed from the course.  If you feel that something I have said during class does not support your 
                            right to be yourself, please let me know.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I will often ask you to talk or work in small groups.  You should contribute to your groups in meaningful ways.  If 
                            you would prefer to work on a task individually, please feel comfortable to let me know.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            During class, you may think and write in whichever language you choose.  However, please be aware that there are very 
                            few languages that I can read fluently.  So, please try to write submitted work in English (or something that I can 
                            read).  Also note that talking in small groups will require you to communicate effectively with each other.
                        </p>

                            Class attendance and participation is important for this course.  Please come to our classroom before the time begins 
                            and plan to stay until the end of the period.  You are welcome to leave the class for short periods of time as 
                            necessary.  However, arriving to class extremely late or disappearing for long periods of time will be considered as 
                            an absence.

                            Let's do it.  Let's talk about AI.  No college course is about you turning some pieces of paper that say the right 
                            thing for college credit.  It is about learning what you need to succeed in your career, becoming an educated and 
                            compassionate citizen, and learning how to formulate your own ideas and communicate them effectively.  I am not 
                            opposed to you using AI <em>appropriately</em>.  Here is the general rule for this course: <em>AI should not be 
                            used to generate ideas.</em>  Use it to correct your grammar.  Use it to delve deeper into a topic you want to know 
                            more about.  Do not ask AI to write out a solution or submission for any assignment.  This includes ``just using it to 
                            check an answer.''  Your submitted assignments should be a representation of how you connect with the material.  
                            Using AI inappropriately will be considered a violation of the University's Academic Honesty Policy.  If you have any 
                            questions about appropriate AI use, please let me know. 
                        </p>

                            I understand that life happens.  Sometimes, unexpected things require us to focus on other things.  I will keep this 
                            in mind regarding attendance assignment submission.  However, I will expect honest, timely, and open communication.  
                            If you need to miss a class to attend a major event, let me know ahead of time so we can work something out.  Poor 
                            communication or ghosting the course are harder things to be flexible about.

                        <p>
                            Feel safe but avoid safetyism.  Safetyism is an obsession with eliminating or avoiding threats (even imaginary ones) 
                            to such an extent that you are unwilling to make reasonable trade-offs or accommodations necessitated by practical 
                            or moral concerns.  It is the belief that it is unhealthy to experience negative emotions.  In order to learn, you 
                            need to struggle a bit.  No one is a master of everything.  It's ok to feel confused.  It's ok to be disappointed.  
                            It's ok think about things that are a bit uncomfortable.  A big part of this course will be reflecting on how you 
                            relate to money.  I'll tell you now, you're going to have a lot of negative emotions regarding finances over your 
                            life.  This course will help you prepare for those emotions, but you need to be willing to really think and explore 
                            your own mind.  Don't withdraw from challenge.  Don't hide from life.

                    Let's actually get started with personal finance.  Here is the thing.  Personal finance courses can be pretty ubiquitous.  
                    There are some things we'll definitely touch on, but you may have some particular questions about personal finance that 
                    you are hoping to explore in this course.  I'd like to include some of your questions, if possible.  So, your first activity 
                    for the course will be

                to come up with three questions regarding personal finance that you would like to see covered in 
                this course.  I'm not promising to answer everything.  (I won't tell you what stocks to buy.)  But please ask about things 
                you are genuinely interested in.

                I'm assuming you chose to enroll in this course for a reason.  Yes, you earn college credit and tick off one of the 
                ``Wellness'' courses.  But really, why are you here?  Why did you choose this course and why are you interested in personal finance?  
                If you do not want to learn personal finance and are simply ``stuck'' here, why do you not want to learn personal finance?  Talk with

                What I hope we can see is that <em>why</em> personal finance is needed or interesting differs from person to person.  It 
                depends on who we are.  People who are very future oriented may want to know about how to best prepare for the future.  
                People who are spenders may want to see some techniques for making a paycheck stretch further.  People may have heard that 
                certain concepts are important but don't know much about them.  There are many more potential reasons to be interested in 
                personal finance.  They're all valid.
            </p>

            <p>
                Notice that this means that there is no singular, concrete goal for this course.  We all will appreciate different topics.  
                What is important is that you understand why <em>you</em> are interested in personal finance, and your reason is a good one.

                    We all have different ways in which we relate to money.  Some people despise money and think of it as the root of all 
                    evil.  Some adore or worship money and wealth.  Some are very indifferent to money.  No relationship to money is the 
                    ``right'' one or the ``wrong'' one.  However, how you think about money absolutely influences your life, both 
                    day-to-day and long term.  Setting financial goals is important, but if you try to set goals while ignoring your 
                    connection to money, you are likely setting yourself up for failure.

                You are going to take a short quiz.  There are no right answers.  There are ``points'' assigned to different options, but 
                ``points'' are not necessarily a good thing or bad thing.  For each question, do not answer as if anyone will look at these 
                because no one will.  Do not answer based on what you think is the most socially acceptable.  Really think about each question 
                and be comfortable selecting the answer that best describes you.  Please note that this is not an ``official'' test.  It is 
                just meant to get you to start thinking about your own connection to money.
