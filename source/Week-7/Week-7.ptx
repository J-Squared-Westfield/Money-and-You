            <title>Introduction to Rate of Return</title>
            <p>
                There are a few measures of how successful your savings and investment outcomes are.
                One basic one is the <alert>return on investment</alert> or ROI.
                Your ROI can be calculated as:
                <me>
                    ROI = \frac{\text{Ending value of investment} - \text{Starting value of investment}}{Starting value of investment}\times 100\%.
                </me>
                If your ROI is positive, it means that your investment has increased by your ROI percentage since your original investment.
                If your ROI is negative, it means that your investment has decreased in value by your ROI percentage.
            </p>

            <p>
                For example, suppose you invest $1,000.
                Sometime later, your investment is valued at $1,250.
                Then your ROI would be <m>\displaystyle ROI = \frac{1,250 - 1,000}{1,000}\times 100 = 25\%.</m> Your investment has grown by 25%.
            </p>

            <p>
                The issue with ROI is that it measures only how one investment has grown over some unknown time period.
                It is then difficult to compare different ROI’s without setting some standards,
            </p>

            <p>
                The gold standard for measuring how successful your savings and investment outcomes are is the <alert>rate of return</alert>.
                The rate of return is a measurement of how your investments have grown or decayed each year.
                For example, if your rate of return on your 401(k) were 8%, that means that, on average, your investments in your 401(k) have increased by 8%each year.
            </p>

            <p>
                The issue with rate of return is that it is difficult to compute exactly by hand.
                There are some approximations for it, but the computations are still tedious.
                What is important is how to interpret the rate of return for an investment.
            </p>

            <p>
                From a computational standpoint, you can, in a way, think of your rate of return as the “interest’’ you have earned by investing your money.
                It isn’t exactly interest because your investment values can increase or decrease each day, but long term one way to think of rate of return is a measurement of the “interest rate” you’ve earned per year, on average.
                Consider the following example:
            </p>

            <p>
                Suppose that Katherine invests $1,000 in a project that guarantees a rate of return of 10%over the next five years.
                How much will her investment be worth after 5 years?
            </p>

            <p>
                If we treat that rate of return like interest, we can use compounding to get the investment value after 5 years.
                After the first year, her investment would be worth <m>1,000\times (1.1) = \$1,100.</m> After the second year, her investment would be worth <m>1,100\times (1.1) = \$1,210</m>.
                After three, it would be <m>1,210 \times (1.1) = \$1,331</m>.
                After four, it would be <m>1,331 \times (1.1) = \$1,464.10.</m>.
                After five, it would be <m>1,464.10 \times (1.1) = \$1,610.51</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
                We can shortcut this idea.
                Suppose you invest and amount <m>P</m> and that the rate of return is <m>r</m> (as a decimal).
                Then after a period of <m>t</m> years, the investment would be worth <m>P\times (1+r)^{t}</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
                You can also go backward.
                Suppose that you can invest with a rate of return of <m>r</m> and that you need to have an amount <m>A</m> after <m>t</m> years.
                Then the amount you would need to invest now is <m>\displaystyle \frac{A}{(1+r)^{t}}</m>.
            </p> 

            <p>
                In general, rates of return are guaranteed for low-risk savings/investments such as savings accounts, CDs, and bonds.
                However, for higher-risk investments, rates of return are rarely guaranteed.
                (Otherwise, they wouldn’t be risky.)

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-What-is-good-Return">
            <title>What is a Good Rate of Return?</title>
            <p>
                First, to discuss what a “good’’ rate of return for an investment is, we need to understand why people invest money.
                People risk their money with investments so that they will (hopefully) come away richer afterwards.
                Become wealthier means having more “buying power.’’ However, this does not simply mean more money.
            </p>

            <p>
                Consider this - who had more buying power?: Someone with $1,000 in 1900 or someone with $2,000 today? Considering that a house in 1900 would have cost around $3,000-$5,000 and that $2,000 wouldn’t even get you a five minute shopping spree at Sephora, that $1,000 in 1900 had way more buying power.
                Why? Inflation.
            </p>

            <p>
                <alert>Inflation</alert> is a natural byproduct of a money-based economy. Over time, the costs of goods and services increase. In response, wages and salaries need to increase. The effect of inflation is that the value of currency decreases over time. Inflation is often measured as an annual compound rate. Average inflation rates are thrown around. A common one to use in the United States is 3%. Of course, year to year, this can vary quite a bit.
            </p>

            <p>
                Consider this example.
                Suppose that 10 years ago an item cost $100.
                Average inflation has been 3%.
                How much would the item cost today?
            </p>

            <p>
                We can calculate this similar to how we found ending values for investments: <m>\displaystyle 100 \times (1.03)^{10}= \$134.39</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
                The reason we need to consider inflation when comparing investment returns can be seen in the following example.
            </p>

            <p>
                Suppose Regina would like to increase her wealth.
                She invests $1,000.
                After five years, her rate of return was 4%.
                However, inflation was 5%.
                Did Regina increase her wealth?
            </p>

            <p>
                At the end of five years, Regina’s investment becomes <m>1,000\times (1.04)^{5} = \$1,216.65.</m> However, an item that cost $1,000 would cost <m>1,000\times (1.05)^{5} = \$1,276.28</m>.
                So, she could no longer afford an item that she could afford five years prior.
                So, while Regina did earn money, she lost buying power.
                So, she actually lost wealth.
            </p>

            <p>
                Here is what to take away from this exercise: <alert>If you earn a rate of return that is less than inflation, you are actually losing wealth.</alert> 
                Of course, a small rate of return is better than no return at all.
            </p>

            <p>
                So, what is a “good” rate of return for an investment? Hopefully, it is clear that a “good’’ rate of return is at least as large as normal inflation.
                However, you would also like to increase wealth on top of simply keeping up with inflation.
                There is no universally-accepted number that defines a “good’’ rate of return.
                However, many people say that 7%has historically been a solid rate of return that can be expected from fairly passive investments in financial markets.
                So, some people say that 7%of above are “good’’ rates of return.
            </p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Rule-of-72">
            <title>Rule of 72</title>
            <p>
                Because people don’t tend to like whipping out a calculator everytime they talk about investments, some people use the <alert>Rule of 72</alert> to think about how investments will grow under a certain rate of return.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Rule of 72 allows someone to approximate how long it will take an investment to double with a given rate of return.
                If <m>R\%</m> is your investment rate of return as a percent, then the approximate time for an investment to double can be calculated as <m>\frac{72}{R}</m> years.
                For example, if your rate of return for an investment were 7.2%, then it would take approximately <m>\frac{72}{7.2}= 10</m> years for your money to double.
            </p>

            <p>
                10 years may sound like a long time for money to double.
                The thing is that returns <em>compound.</em> This means that if your money doubles after 7 years, that doubled amount doubles after the next 7 years.
                That quadrupled amount doubles after the next 7 years.
                And so on.
            </p>

            <p>
                Consider the following example.
            </p>

            <p>
                Suppose you inherit $10,000 from a relative today.
                You want to invest the money in a mutual fund that earns a rate of return so that your money doubles every ten years.
                How much would you have when you retire in 50 years?
            </p>

            <p>
                In ten years, you would have $20,000.
                After 20, that $20,000 doubles to $40,000.
                After 30 years, that doubles to $80,000.
                After 40 years, that doubles to $160,000.
                After 50 years, that doubles to $320,000.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Rule of 72 can help you compare rates of return in a different way.
                For example, suppose you compare rates of return of 5%and 10%.
                Using the Rule of 72, under a 5%rate of return, it would take <m>\frac{72}{5}= 14.4</m> years for your investments to double.
                Under a 10%rate of return, it would take <m>\frac{72}{10}= 7.2</m> years for your investments to double.

            <title>Why Retire?</title>
            <p>
                To retire from work means to fully or partially leave the workforce.
                For most people, even those who love their jobs, there comes a point when your body can no longer handle the demands of a full-time job.
                Whether it is to focus on family, take time for more life experiences, or simply to stop working a demanding job, most people want to retire from work.

            <title>Saving for Retirement - the Whys</title>
            <p>
                Imagine that you have been working the same job for 40 years and have been earning reliable paychecks of $6,000 per month to pay for your housing, taxes, food, utilities, etc.
                Imagine that you decide to retire and that your paychecks stop immediately.
                How do you pay for your expenses? How do you survive?
            </p>

            <p>
                In the past, American culture used to center around homesteads in which multiple generations lived and worked.
                Parents would raise children who would work on or near these homesteads.
                When the children were grown and raising their own families, the parents could do less work around the homesteads as their bodies aged.
                As industry progressed, families moved further apart, meaning elderly parents are much less likely to be supported by their adult children once they are unable to work.
                From this, the concept of saving for retirement evolved.
            </p>

            <p>
                We want to save for retirement so that we can afford a similar lifestyle to what we’re accustomed to while working.
                Saving for retirement means having realistic ideas of what your costs will be when you reach retirement age.
                Housing, medical care, food, taxes, entertainment, transportation, etc.
                There is a great deal you need to plan for.
                Unfortunately, not only do you lose your paychecks when you retire, many of your expenses increase.
                As your body ages, it will need more expensive medical care.
                As your house value increases, you’ll pay more in property taxes.
                Of course, there’s also inflation, making everything cost more.
            </p>

            <p>
                What I am getting at is that retirement has a big price tag.
                This, combined with the power of how fast money can grow with investments, leads to the following mantra: “The best time to start saving for retirement is as soon as possible.”

                Now, consider the following scenario.
                Suppose you are 20 years old.
                You would like to retire when you turn 65 (45 years from now).
                Suppose all you can save is $10 per week (or $40 per month).
                Suppose that you can earn a typical 7%rate of return on your investments.

            <p>
                How much do you need to retire? That is a really, really hard question to answer.
                It highly depends on the lifestyle you want to live after retirement.
                Do you want to travel the world in five-star hotels? Then you’ll need quite the hefty sum.
                Do you want to live in a quiet one-room cabin in the woods? Then you’ll need much less.
                It also depends on unknown factors such as how long you’ll live, whether or not you’ll develop costly medical conditions, how inflation works out over time, tax policies, and so on.

                As a <em>really basic, overly-simplistic</em> rule of thumb, I would recommend that you want to have about 10-13 years worth of your highest year’s salary saved up.
                This comes with a huge note.
                You don’t know what you’ll earn in your highest-salary year as that is usually your last year you will work.
                Here’s what you can do to help estimate how much you’ll want to have for retirement.
                Look up the average salary for someone with your preferred career in the area you want to live.
                For example, suppose you want to be a nurse in Boston; a rudimentary interest search says that the average salary for a nurse in Boston is about $100,000.
                Now, adjust that figure for inflation how many years into the future you will retire.
                Suppose that you will retire 40 years from now.
                Then that $100,000 figure becomes <m>100,000\times (1.03)^{40}= \$326,204.</m> The number you get represents a very rough estimate of your salary when you reach retirement age.
                Finally, to get how much you need for retirement, multiply that by a factor of 10, 11, 12, or 13.
                So, on a low end, you’d want around <m>326,204 \times 10 = \$3,262,040</m> to retire.
                On the high end, you’d want around <m>326,204 \times 13 = \$4,240, 649.13</m> to retire.
            </p>

            <p>
                Please pay attention to the following:
            </p>

            <p>
                <alert>If you are relatively young (teens, 20’s, 30’s), the process I outlined above is essentially useless!</alert>
            </p>

            <p>
                It is useless because there is so much that is unpredictable.
                However, it can be a valuable exercise if you want to consider the scale of how much you need to retire.
                Yes, you will likely need to be a millionaire in order to retire.
                Keep in mind that while these numbers are quite high, your salaries will increase over time as well.
                It isn’t as daunting as it seems.

                Suppose you are 25 years old and would like to start saving for retirement.
                Your job currently pays you $85,000 annually, which comes to $5,000 per month after taxes.
                You follow the 50-30-20 budgeting plan and put 20%of your take-home pay ($1,000) into savings.

            <title>Debrief: How Realistic is this Savings Plan?</title>
            <p>
                Do a bit of research online.
                Look at average salaries for college graduates in Massachusetts.
                Imagine sharing a house with a partner who makes a similar income.
                Imagine sticking to a 50-30-20 plan.
                Remember that your pay will increase over your lifetime due to inflation and pay raises.
                If you consider all of these, the scenario above is quite realistic.
                However, it hinges on starting early.
            </p>

            <p>
                On top of this, you will likely have other opportunities to have retirement income on top of what you save (e.g.
                Social Security, employer-sponsored plans, etc.) to supplement your retirement.
                So, if you were intimidated by the large numbers in the previous section, remember that retirement is very much possible due to the power of rates of return (exponential growth) and starting early.

    <section xml:id="sec-Social-Security">
        <title>Social Security</title>
        <p>
            We will begin with the most common, and most messy, way to save for retirement - the United States Social Security Program.  
        </p>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-What-SS-Is">
            <title>What Social Security Is</title>
            <p>
                We’ll first discuss what Social Security means to you practically for retirement.
                Most jobs in the United States are “covered” by Social Security.
                For covered jobs, there is a 12.4% tax on your earnings that funds the Social Security program.
                However, by Federal law, half is paid by employers.
                So, 6.2% of your earnings is taxed and is paid by you, and an equivalent amount is paid by your employer.
                There is a maximum amount that is taxed (currently up to $176,100).
            </p>

            <p>
                If you work for at least what is equivalent to ten years in a covered job, you are then eligible to receive payments once you reach a certain age.
                These payments help fund living after you stop working.
                What constitutes “ten years” is a little confusing now.
                You need to earn 40 “credits,” and you can earn up to 4 credits per year.
                To earn a credit, you must earn $1,810 in a covered job in a year.
                If you make four times that ($7,240), you earn 4 credits that year.
            </p>

            <p>
                The amount you get per month when you start to “collect” from Social Security depends on a number of factors.
                It depends on how much you earned in your most recent years of employment (and thus paid in taxes), when you start to collect, how much your spouse’s benefits are, etc.
                The biggest one people consider is the age to start collecting.
                The earliest you can start collecting is age 62, but this is considered “early.” Hence, there is a reduction in your monthly payments (forever).
                The “full” retirement age is now 67.
                If you hold off on collecting past that, your payments will increase as a bonus to a maximum of age 70.
            </p>

            <p>
                Most retired people in the US depend on Social Security in order to survive.
                For most of you, it will be a system you are part of, pay into, and collect from.
                Some people are “exempt” from the Social Security system.
                People who work for state or municipal governments with public pension plans are usually not covered by social security.
                For example, Massachusetts teachers and police officers do not pay Social Security tax nor do they receive benefits (unless they work a second job that is covered).
            </p>

            <p>
                If you are wondering how much you’ll get from Social Security, it isn’t much.
                The absolute maximum someone can get now (2025) is $5,108 per month.
                That is only if they retire after age 70 and earned at least $176,100 over the past 10 years.
                More realistically, the average Social Security payment last year was $1,900 per month.
            </p>

            <p>
                Social Security is not just about supplying income to retired people, but that is the largest part of it by far.
            </p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-What-SS-Isnt">
            <title>What Social Security Isn't</title>
            <p>
                Social Security is one of the most discussed topics for politicians, and there is a great deal of misunderstanding regarding the program.
            </p>

            <p>
                One of the most common misunderstandings about it is that Social Security is not actually a retirement program.
                It’s an <alert>insurance</alert> program.
                In fact, it’s true name is “The Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance.” It is an insurance for people who live “too long.” The original foundation of the program interpreted living “too long” as living past when your body is able to do work.
                Social Security was designed to help those who could not longer work <em>survive</em> a post-employment life.
                It may be depressing to think of Social Security that way, but remember that it was created at a time when the majority of retired people lived in poverty.
            </p>

            <p>
                Another misconception is that Social Security is meant to keep retired people in the lifestyles they’re accustomed to.
                You may have noticed that the average Social Security payment of $1,900 is really low - not nearly enough to live a middle-class lifestyle.
                Remember, Social Security is meant to help those who have outlived their employment lives <em>survive</em>, not be comfortable.
                Realistically, paying only 6.2%of your income in taxes really isn’t enough to fund decades of post-work life.
                So, <alert>Social Security is not enough to fund your retirement, and it was never intended to be.</alert>
            </p>

            <p>
                One major misconception is how Social Security actually funds the payments it makes.
                Many people believe that Social Security acts like a huge retirement account.
                That is, you make payments into the system, and the Government invests that money so that it grows and is there for you when you retire.
                This isn’t how Social Security works.
                Social Security is a “pay-as-you-go” system.
                That is, Social Security payments that are being made to day come directly from those paying the Social Security taxes now.
                So, you are currently funding the payments for retired folk today.
                When you start to collect from Social Security, your payments will be funded by those in the workforce.
            </p>

            <p>
                One matter of constant debate is whether Social Security is a program someone is entitled to after working a certain number of years or whether it is a program to help someone live for a certain number of years past retirement.
                When the program was created, these were essentially the same.
                The retirement age of 62 was chosen as an approximate age when people could no longer work and an age that many did not even live to see.
                Thanks to advanced in medicine and living standards, people are able to work longer and live well past that age.
                However, the retirement age has only gone up to 67.
                The debate on whether this retirement age is practical or just is constantly debated.
                On one end, people who work until 67 have worked just as long and hard as those in previous generations.
                However, those people are expected to live in post-work living way beyond previous generations.
                It isn’t an easy debate to solve.

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-SS-going-away">
            <title>Is Social Security Going Away?</title>
            
            <p>
                The short answer is I don’t know.
            </p>

            <p>
                You may have heard about Social Security and solvency issues or “running out of money.” There is some truth to this.
                Social Security isn’t exactly going to “run out” of money.
                In 7-9 years, the number of retired individuals will be greater than what the workforce will be able to fund.
                So, if Social Security does not receive more revenue, Social Security payments will need to be reduced.
                There are a few stray politician who will say that Social Security needs to go away entirely (but keep the taxes).
            </p>

            <p>
                One factor that complicates this is that Social Security was moved into the general Federal budget.
                This was done at a time when Social Security was well funded and moving it into the general budget made it look like the full budget was balanced.
                Being in the general budget makes some aspects of the revenue/cost streams of Social Security harder to analyze.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are essentially two ways to make Social Security “solvent” or able to pay for itself - either increase revenues or decrease costs.
            </p>

            <p>
                Decreasing costs would be simple, but very unpopular.
                This can happen either by reducing payment amounts or raising the retirement age.
                Current rand future retirees don’t want their payments decreasing, and those looking toward retirement don’t want to have to work for longer.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are a number of ways revenues could increase for Social Security.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The maximum taxable income could be raised.
                        That is, those with very high incomes would pay more into Social Security (and get more in payments).
                        This is uncommon with the wealthy as investing in markets is seen as a better use of their money over paying into Social Security.
                        Since it’s unpopular with the wealthy, few politicians want to explore this option.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>
                        The tax percentage on wages could be increased.
                        This has been done multiple times before.
                        The original Social Security tax was 2%.
                        It’s now 12.6%.
                        Of course, tax increases are never popular.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>
                        Raise the retirement age.
                        While also reducing costs, raising the retirement age encourages people to work longer.
                        However, most people do not want to have to work longer before retirement.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>
                        Providing work visas to immigrant workers will increase the workforce.
                        We have an aging workforce, meaning that there are too few young and middle-aged people working.
                        Undocumented workers generally do not pay taxes as they are paid “under the table.” Including these workers into the main workforce would significantly boost revenues into Social Security.
                        However, immigration is a big issue for many US citizens, and this option is very unpopular for some.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>
                        Increasing taxes on the very wealthy would provide more funding.
                        Since Social Security is in the general budget, it can be funded via any revenues.
                        The taxes on the wealthy (and only the the very wealthy) have dropped by more than half in the past 40 years.
                        Increasing that tax rate for the very wealthy even a small amount could re-fund Social Security.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>
                        Transferring funding from another program/department could increase revenues.
                        Those opposed to increased taxes on the wealthy usually support decreasing funding in other areas of the government.
                        Of course, decreasing funding in other areas means those programs/benefits are less available.
                    </p>

                The problem with funding Social Security is a difficult one.
                Somebody needs to pay for it, and no one wants to.
                The clock is ticking, and a decision is going to have to be made.

            <title>Employer-Sponsored Retirement</title>
            <p>
                Due to the societal shift away from family homesteads to areas of industry, there grew a demand for financial security after a life in the work force.
                In order to attract the best workers, employers began offering benefits that help their employees save for retirement.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are essentially two flavors of employer-sponsored retirement plans.
            </p>

            <p>
                A <alert>defined benefit plan</alert> is a plan in which the employer makes a guarantee to pay a well-defined amount to an employee after they retire.
                The most common form of a defined benefit plan is a <alert>pension</alert> in which an employer makes a promise to make regular (usually monthly) payments to a retired employee until their death or a certain amount of time after retirement.
                We’ll discuss these more in the next section.
            </p>

            <p>
                Because defined benefit plans put the burden of funding retirement completely on the employer, many employers have shifted to a <alert>defined contribution plan</alert> for their employees.
                Under these plans, employers put a defined amount of money into an account on your behalf.
                When you retire, you have access to the funds in this account.
                The idea is that these funds are invested and will grow long-term into a sizeable amount.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are benefits and drawbacks to each plan type.
                Form the worker’s viewpoint, defined benefit plans offer the best security as retirement is up to their employer.
                However, workers can feel “trapped” in their jobs as they will lose much of the benefits of their plan if they change careers.
                Defined contribution plans allow for more freedom in employment as retirement accounts are usually transferrable.
                Form an employer point of view, defined contribution plans are preferred as there are no long-term commitments that they must honor.
            </p>

            <p>
                These days, most employer-sponsored plans are defined-contribution plans.
            </p>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-401k-403b">
            <title>401(k)'s and 403(b)'s</title>
            <p>
                Taxation is a little tricky with regards to savings.
                The philosophy is, if you put money aside to use way into the future, is it really income? Because of this question, most retirement plans come in the form of a 401(k) or 403(b) plan.
            </p>

            <p>
                In most ways, 401(k)’s and 403(b)’s are the same.
                The biggest difference is that for-profit companies generally sponsor 401(k) plans, and non-profit institutions generally offer 403(b) plans.
                These plans must be sponsored by an employer (you can’t just open your own).
            </p>

            <p>
                Under one of these plans, you have the option of deducting some of your pay to be deposited into your personal plan account.
                Many employers will also contribute funds as a “matching,” up to a certain percentage of your income.
                For example, if your employer offers 5%matching, for every dollar you deduct into your account, up to 5%of your annual pay, your employer will also contribute a dollar.
                If you deduct more than 5%of your total pay, your employer will not contribute any more.
                For example, suppose you earn $100,000 and your employer matches 7%for your retirement plan.
                If you deduct 4%of your pay in a year ($4,000), your employer would match that, making your total amount put into your account $8,000.
                If you deduct 7%($7,000), your employer would match that, making your total amount put into the account $14,000.
                If you deduct 10%of your pay ($10,000), your employer would still only contribute 7%($7,000).
                So, the total deduction would be $17,000.
            </p>

            <p>
                <alert>In general, employer matching is considered part of your total compensation. You should always try to maximize employer contributions. Otherwise, you are not making the most you could from your job.</alert>
            </p>

            <p>
                Currently, the most you can contribute each year in a 401(k) or 403(b) is $23,500.
                If you’re over 50, you can contribute $31,000.

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Taxation-and-Roth-Accounts">
            <title>Taxation and Roth Accounts</title>
            <p>
                There are two ways to enjoy the tax benefits of a 401(k) or 403(b) plan.
                It depends on whether your account is a “traditional” or a “Roth” account.
            </p>

            <p>
                With a traditional retirement account, any contributions you make reduce your taxable income for the year.
                For example, suppose you make $100,000 (pre-tax) and contribute $10,000 to your 401(k).
                Then only $90,000 of your pay is taxed.
                The downside to this is that when you retire and begin withdrawing money from your 401(k), that money is then taxed as regular income.
                So, if your 401(k)/403(b) is your main source of retirement income, you will need more saved up with a traditional account because of taxes you’ll pay when you withdraw money.
            </p>

            <p>
                With a Roth retirement account, any contributions you make are made after you pay taxes on your pay.
                So, if you make $100,000 (pre-tax) and contribute $10,000 to your 401(k), you will still be taxed on your full $100,000.
                However, when you make withdrawals from your account when you retire, that income is completely untaxed.
                Generally, you need to save a bit less with Roth accounts because of the lack of taxation with withdrawals.
            </p>

            <p>
                You often have a choice of a traditional or Roth account.
                The choice depends on a number of factors.
                People with higher incomes often select traditional accounts to reduce their tax burden each year.
                People who start a 401(k)/403(b) later in life also tend toward traditional accounts as they will earn less in investment income.
                People who start accounts earlier in life often choose Roth accounts as they will earn more in investment income but can avoid taxes on it.

            <title>IRA</title>
            <p>
                An <alert>individual retirement plan</alert> is essentially a self-sponsored 401(k).
                An IRA is an account you open yourself and fund yourself.
                IRA’s are meant to act as methods to supplement retirement incomes.
            </p>

            <p>
                Practically, IRA’s function a lot like employer-sponsored plans.
                You can contribute up to a certain amount (currently $7,000 per year).
                You can have either a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your taxation preferences.
            </p>

            <p>
                One common misconception is that you cannot have both a 401(k) and an IRA.
                You absolutely can! And you should!
            </p>

            <p>
                The main difference with an IRA and employer-sponsored accounts is when you see the tax benefits in a traditional account.
                In a traditional IRA, you still deposit money into an account after taxes are paid from your paycheck, making it feel like a Roth account.
                However, when you file taxes, you can then deduct the amount you contributed from your taxable income, which will increase your tax refund (or reduce your taxes owed).

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-The-Beauty-of-Pensions">
            <title>The Beauty of Pensions</title>
            <p>
                When employers first began offering retirement incentives to employees, most offered defined-benefit plans in the form of pensions.
                Under a pension, employees have a portion of their pay deducted from their checks over their entire career.
                The employers use these deductions to invest in various markets.
                When an employee retires, the employer is obligated to pay a pre-determined amount to the employee until their death.
                </p>

            <p>
                Pensions come in all sorts of flavors.
                Some even come with guaranteed healthcare for life.
                Some will continue to make payments to surviving spouses after the employee’s death.
                How much an employee gets usually depends on how long they worked for the employer and how much they made.
            </p>

            <p>
                Unfortunately, pensions are expensive.
                And due to huge increases in life expectancies, many pensions are under-funded and cannot fully live up to the promises made.
                Thus, pensions are becoming increasingly rare.
                Massachusetts still has a state-sponsored pension system.
                It is completely funded by state employees (non-state employees don’t pay a penny in funding it).
                It is decently well-funded.
                Currently, the pension offers a maximum payment amount equal to 80%of the average of your five highest-paid years of salary, which is one of the highest available in the world of pensions.
            </p>

            <p>
                One thing to keep in mind with pensions is that all payments are taxable.
            </p>

            <p>
                The biggest downside of pensions is that there is no account that can be transferred to another employer (unless it is in the same system, such as moving from one state job to another state job).
                In this sense, employees can become “trapped” in a job because they do not want to give up what they’ve put into a pension.
            </p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Vesting">
            <title>Vesting</title>
            Generally, pension plans come with a “vesting period.” In order to be eligible for pension payments, workers have to work for a minimum number of years.
            Once they reach that minimum number, they are “vested” in the pension.
            Being vested means that you are legally entitled to pension payments, according to the underlying agreements.
            For example, in the Massachusetts state pension system, there is a vesting period of 10 years.
            Often, once you are vested, you can leave the job and still receive some kind of payment when you retire (usually much reduced).
            If you leave a job before you are vested, you will have whatever you contributed to the plan returned to you, and you will not be entitled to any pension payments when you retire.
