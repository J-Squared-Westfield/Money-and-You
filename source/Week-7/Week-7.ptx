            <title>Introduction to Rate of Return</title>
            <p>
                There are a few measures of how successful your savings and investment outcomes are.
                One basic one is the <alert>return on investment</alert> or ROI.
                Your ROI can be calculated as:
                <me>
                    ROI = \frac{\text{Ending value of investment} - \text{Starting value of investment}}{Starting value of investment}\times 100\%.
                </me>
                If your ROI is positive, it means that your investment has increased by your ROI percentage since your original investment.
                If your ROI is negative, it means that your investment has decreased in value by your ROI percentage.
            </p>

            <p>
                For example, suppose you invest $1,000.
                Sometime later, your investment is valued at $1,250.
                Then your ROI would be <m>\displaystyle ROI = \frac{1,250 - 1,000}{1,000}\times 100 = 25\%.</m> Your investment has grown by 25%.
            </p>

            <p>
                The issue with ROI is that it measures only how one investment has grown over some unknown time period.
                It is then difficult to compare different ROI’s without setting some standards,
            </p>

            <p>
                The gold standard for measuring how successful your savings and investment outcomes are is the <alert>rate of return</alert>.
                The rate of return is a measurement of how your investments have grown or decayed each year.
                For example, if your rate of return on your 401(k) were 8%, that means that, on average, your investments in your 401(k) have increased by 8%each year.
            </p>

            <p>
                The issue with rate of return is that it is difficult to compute exactly by hand.
                There are some approximations for it, but the computations are still tedious.
                What is important is how to interpret the rate of return for an investment.
            </p>

            <p>
                From a computational standpoint, you can, in a way, think of your rate of return as the “interest’’ you have earned by investing your money.
                It isn’t exactly interest because your investment values can increase or decrease each day, but long term one way to think of rate of return is a measurement of the “interest rate” you’ve earned per year, on average.
                Consider the following example:
            </p>

            <p>
                Suppose that Katherine invests $1,000 in a project that guarantees a rate of return of 10%over the next five years.
                How much will her investment be worth after 5 years?
            </p>

            <p>
                If we treat that rate of return like interest, we can use compounding to get the investment value after 5 years.
                After the first year, her investment would be worth <m>1,000\times (1.1) = \$1,100.</m> After the second year, her investment would be worth <m>1,100\times (1.1) = \$1,210</m>.
                After three, it would be <m>1,210 \times (1.1) = \$1,331</m>.
                After four, it would be <m>1,331 \times (1.1) = \$1,464.10.</m>.
                After five, it would be <m>1,464.10 \times (1.1) = \$1,610.51</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
                We can shortcut this idea.
                Suppose you invest and amount <m>P</m> and that the rate of return is <m>r</m> (as a decimal).
                Then after a period of <m>t</m> years, the investment would be worth <m>P\times (1+r)^{t}</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
                You can also go backward.
                Suppose that you can invest with a rate of return of <m>r</m> and that you need to have an amount <m>A</m> after <m>t</m> years.
                Then the amount you would need to invest now is <m>\displaystyle \frac{A}{(1+r)^{t}}</m>.
            </p> 

            <p>
                In general, rates of return are guaranteed for low-risk savings/investments such as savings accounts, CDs, and bonds.
                However, for higher-risk investments, rates of return are rarely guaranteed.
                (Otherwise, they wouldn’t be risky.)

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-What-is-good-Return">
            <title>What is a Good Rate of Return?</title>
            <p>
                First, to discuss what a “good’’ rate of return for an investment is, we need to understand why people invest money.
                People risk their money with investments so that they will (hopefully) come away richer afterwards.
                Become wealthier means having more “buying power.’’ However, this does not simply mean more money.
            </p>

            <p>
                Consider this - who had more buying power?: Someone with $1,000 in 1900 or someone with $2,000 today? Considering that a house in 1900 would have cost around $3,000-$5,000 and that $2,000 wouldn’t even get you a five minute shopping spree at Sephora, that $1,000 in 1900 had way more buying power.
                Why? Inflation.
            </p>

            <p>
                <alert>Inflation</alert> is a natural byproduct of a money-based economy. Over time, the costs of goods and services increase. In response, wages and salaries need to increase. The effect of inflation is that the value of currency decreases over time. Inflation is often measured as an annual compound rate. Average inflation rates are thrown around. A common one to use in the United States is 3%. Of course, year to year, this can vary quite a bit.
            </p>

            <p>
                Consider this example.
                Suppose that 10 years ago an item cost $100.
                Average inflation has been 3%.
                How much would the item cost today?
            </p>

            <p>
                We can calculate this similar to how we found ending values for investments: <m>\displaystyle 100 \times (1.03)^{10}= \$134.39</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
                The reason we need to consider inflation when comparing investment returns can be seen in the following example.
            </p>

            <p>
                Suppose Regina would like to increase her wealth.
                She invests $1,000.
                After five years, her rate of return was 4%.
                However, inflation was 5%.
                Did Regina increase her wealth?
            </p>

            <p>
                At the end of five years, Regina’s investment becomes <m>1,000\times (1.04)^{5} = \$1,216.65.</m> However, an item that cost $1,000 would cost <m>1,000\times (1.05)^{5} = \$1,276.28</m>.
                So, she could no longer afford an item that she could afford five years prior.
                So, while Regina did earn money, she lost buying power.
                So, she actually lost wealth.
            </p>

            <p>
                Here is what to take away from this exercise: <alert>If you earn a rate of return that is less than inflation, you are actually losing wealth.</alert> 
                Of course, a small rate of return is better than no return at all.
            </p>

            <p>
                So, what is a “good” rate of return for an investment? Hopefully, it is clear that a “good’’ rate of return is at least as large as normal inflation.
                However, you would also like to increase wealth on top of simply keeping up with inflation.
                There is no universally-accepted number that defines a “good’’ rate of return.
                However, many people say that 7%has historically been a solid rate of return that can be expected from fairly passive investments in financial markets.
                So, some people say that 7%of above are “good’’ rates of return.
            </p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-Rule-of-72">
            <title>Rule of 72</title>
            <p>
                Because people don’t tend to like whipping out a calculator everytime they talk about investments, some people use the <alert>Rule of 72</alert> to think about how investments will grow under a certain rate of return.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Rule of 72 allows someone to approximate how long it will take an investment to double with a given rate of return.
                If <m>R\%</m> is your investment rate of return as a percent, then the approximate time for an investment to double can be calculated as <m>\frac{72}{R}</m> years.
                For example, if your rate of return for an investment were 7.2%, then it would take approximately <m>\frac{72}{7.2}= 10</m> years for your money to double.
            </p>

            <p>
                10 years may sound like a long time for money to double.
                The thing is that returns <em>compound.</em> This means that if your money doubles after 7 years, that doubled amount doubles after the next 7 years.
                That quadrupled amount doubles after the next 7 years.
                And so on.
            </p>

            <p>
                Consider the following example.
            </p>

            <p>
                Suppose you inherit $10,000 from a relative today.
                You want to invest the money in a mutual fund that earns a rate of return so that your money doubles every ten years.
                How much would you have when you retire in 50 years?
            </p>

            <p>
                In ten years, you would have $20,000.
                After 20, that $20,000 doubles to $40,000.
                After 30 years, that doubles to $80,000.
                After 40 years, that doubles to $160,000.
                After 50 years, that doubles to $320,000.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Rule of 72 can help you compare rates of return in a different way.
                For example, suppose you compare rates of return of 5%and 10%.
                Using the Rule of 72, under a 5%rate of return, it would take <m>\frac{72}{5}= 14.4</m> years for your investments to double.
                Under a 10%rate of return, it would take <m>\frac{72}{10}= 7.2</m> years for your investments to double.

            <title>Why Retire?</title>
            <p>
                To retire from work means to fully or partially leave the workforce.
                For most people, even those who love their jobs, there comes a point when your body can no longer handle the demands of a full-time job.
                Whether it is to focus on family, take time for more life experiences, or simply to stop working a demanding job, most people want to retire from work.

            <title>Saving for Retirement - the Whys</title>
            <p>
                Imagine that you have been working the same job for 40 years and have been earning reliable paychecks of $6,000 per month to pay for your housing, taxes, food, utilities, etc.
                Imagine that you decide to retire and that your paychecks stop immediately.
                How do you pay for your expenses? How do you survive?
            </p>

            <p>
                In the past, American culture used to center around homesteads in which multiple generations lived and worked.
                Parents would raise children who would work on or near these homesteads.
                When the children were grown and raising their own families, the parents could do less work around the homesteads as their bodies aged.
                As industry progressed, families moved further apart, meaning elderly parents are much less likely to be supported by their adult children once they are unable to work.
                From this, the concept of saving for retirement evolved.
            </p>

            <p>
                We want to save for retirement so that we can afford a similar lifestyle to what we’re accustomed to while working.
                Saving for retirement means having realistic ideas of what your costs will be when you reach retirement age.
                Housing, medical care, food, taxes, entertainment, transportation, etc.
                There is a great deal you need to plan for.
                Unfortunately, not only do you lose your paychecks when you retire, many of your expenses increase.
                As your body ages, it will need more expensive medical care.
                As your house value increases, you’ll pay more in property taxes.
                Of course, there’s also inflation, making everything cost more.
            </p>

            <p>
                What I am getting at is that retirement has a big price tag.
                This, combined with the power of how fast money can grow with investments, leads to the following mantra: “The best time to start saving for retirement is as soon as possible.”

                Now, consider the following scenario.
                Suppose you are 20 years old.
                You would like to retire when you turn 65 (45 years from now).
                Suppose all you can save is $10 per week (or $40 per month).
                Suppose that you can earn a typical 7%rate of return on your investments.

            <p>
                How much do you need to retire? That is a really, really hard question to answer.
                It highly depends on the lifestyle you want to live after retirement.
                Do you want to travel the world in five-star hotels? Then you’ll need quite the hefty sum.
                Do you want to live in a quiet one-room cabin in the woods? Then you’ll need much less.
                It also depends on unknown factors such as how long you’ll live, whether or not you’ll develop costly medical conditions, how inflation works out over time, tax policies, and so on.

                As a <em>really basic, overly-simplistic</em> rule of thumb, I would recommend that you want to have about 10-13 years worth of your highest year’s salary saved up.
                This comes with a huge note.
                You don’t know what you’ll earn in your highest-salary year as that is usually your last year you will work.
                Here’s what you can do to help estimate how much you’ll want to have for retirement.
                Look up the average salary for someone with your preferred career in the area you want to live.
                For example, suppose you want to be a nurse in Boston; a rudimentary interest search says that the average salary for a nurse in Boston is about $100,000.
                Now, adjust that figure for inflation how many years into the future you will retire.
                Suppose that you will retire 40 years from now.
                Then that $100,000 figure becomes <m>100,000\times (1.03)^{40}= \$326,204.</m> The number you get represents a very rough estimate of your salary when you reach retirement age.
                Finally, to get how much you need for retirement, multiply that by a factor of 10, 11, 12, or 13.
                So, on a low end, you’d want around <m>326,204 \times 10 = \$3,262,040</m> to retire.
                On the high end, you’d want around <m>326,204 \times 13 = \$4,240, 649.13</m> to retire.
            </p>

            <p>
                Please pay attention to the following:
            </p>

            <p>
                <alert>If you are relatively young (teens, 20’s, 30’s), the process I outlined above is essentially useless!</alert>
            </p>

            <p>
                It is useless because there is so much that is unpredictable.
                However, it can be a valuable exercise if you want to consider the scale of how much you need to retire.
                Yes, you will likely need to be a millionaire in order to retire.
                Keep in mind that while these numbers are quite high, your salaries will increase over time as well.
                It isn’t as daunting as it seems.

                Head back to the annuity calculator: <url href="https://www.calculator.net/annuity-calculator.html">https://www.calculator.net/annuity-calculator.html</url>
            </p>

            <p>
                Suppose you are 25 years old and would like to start saving for retirement.
                Your job currently pays you $85,000 annually, which comes to $5,000 per month after taxes.
                You follow the 50-30-20 budgeting plan and put 20%of your take-home pay ($1,000) into savings.
                You put $750 into your retirement account each month and $250 into a general savings account.
            </p>

            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Using the annuity calculator and using $0 as starting principal, $0 as the annual addition, $750 as the monthly addition, and 7%as the annual growth rate, determine how much you’ll have saved in your retirement account in ten years (age 35).
                        </p>
                    </li>

                            After ten years (age 35), you are making more money.
                            You are able to put aside twice as much per month into your retirement account ($1,500 per month).
                            Use your answer to part 1 as the starting principal amount.
                            (The amount already saved up.) Determine how much you’ll have in your retirement account in another ten years (age 45).

                            Use your answer from part 2 as the starting principal amount.
                            Determine how much you’ll have in your retirement account in another ten years (age 55).

                            Use your answer from part 3 as the starting principal amount.
                            Determine how much you’ll have in your retirement account in another ten years (age 65).

            <title>Debrief: How Realistic is this Savings Plan?</title>
            <p>
                Do a bit of research online.
                Look at average salaries for college graduates in Massachusetts.
                Imagine sharing a house with a partner who makes a similar income.
                Imagine sticking to a 50-30-20 plan.
                Remember that your pay will increase over your lifetime due to inflation and pay raises.
                If you consider all of these, the scenario above is quite realistic.
                However, it hinges on starting early.
            </p>

            <p>
                On top of this, you will likely have other opportunities to have retirement income on top of what you save (e.g.
                Social Security, employer-sponsored plans, etc.) to supplement your retirement.
                So, if you were intimidated by the large numbers in the previous section, remember that retirement is very much possible due to the power of rates of return (exponential growth) and starting early.
