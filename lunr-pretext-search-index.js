  "body": " Welcome to Money and You!  Welcome to Money and You! I am thrilled that you are part of my course. I hope that this course will end up being one of your most useful in your undergraduate curriculum. Understanding personal finance and how you think and act about money can benefit you in a number of ways.  Money and You is a twist on a traditional personal finance course. Over the semester, you will learn the fundamentals of managing your money, which you will be able to use for the rest of your life. You will learn techniques for setting a budget; why and how to build credit; the process, benefits, and drawbacks of buying a home; the world of insurance; taxes as they apply to you; loans and debt; car-buying; scams; saving for retirement; using modern finance tools; and setting financial goals.  The twist on this course is the opportunity to reflect on how you (individually) behave around and think about money. You will develop techniques to manage stress about money, explore how money can affect your relationships, reflect on why you want certain things, explore your feelings about risk and reward, and consider why long-term financial goals can be difficult without the proper mindset.   What this course is not   This course is not a how to get rich quickly lesson. It is more of a how to accumulate wealth slowl course. Let's just get this out of the way now. If there were a proven track to move into the upper class, it wouldn't be some secret that is easily divulged in a self-help book or class. The course is about setting and achieving realistic and manageable financial goals.   Source: https:\/\/medium.com\/swlh\/the-way-to-get-rich-quick-is-to-do-it-slowly-3d102cfbea9d     This course is not a course on investment techniques. We will cover how to save for retirement, which can involve investing, but we will not explore specific investment strategies like picking particular stocks or trying to predict the crypto market. We will explore what finance experts do with their own money and why. We will explore general strategies for saving. We will not make any speculations or bets on particular investment opportunities.  Cards on the table, I am a professor of mathematics. However, this course is not a mathematics course. Of course, there will be numbers since money is a quantitative object. You will not need to memorize complex formulas. You will need to be able to understand some arithmetic and how to apply arithmetic in the context of some applied problems, but you will have access to pretty much all computational tools you would like.   Source: https:\/\/imgur.com\/gallery\/dogbert-s-get-rich-quick-scheme-is-scam-FzCOthK      Course Norms  Let's talk about the expectations and norms for this class.    Source: https:\/\/www.edutopia.org\/blog\/ establishing-classroom-norms-todd-finley    First and foremost, everyone should feel welcome and included in this class. Each of us comes into this class with different experiences, identities, ideas, and social positions. You can expect of me to foster an environment in which you can reach your academic goals. I will expect of you, in-turn, to participate in that learning environment and contribute positively to other's learning. Contributing positively to the learning environment means the following expectations (among others):      Everyone is allowed to exist as themselves. Harassing, dismissive, violent, disrespectful, or discriminatory rhetoric\/behavior is not allowed. You are allowed to be who you are. Give that same freedom to others. It is ok to disagree. It is not ok make someone else feel less valuable. I reserve the right to request students who engage in such behavior be removed from the course. If you feel that something I have said during class does not support your right to be yourself, please let me know.    I will often ask you to talk or work in small groups. You should contribute to your groups in meaningful ways. If you would prefer to work on a task individually, please feel comfortable to let me know.    During class, you may think and write in whichever language you choose. However, please be aware that there are very few languages that I can read fluently. So, please try to write submitted work in English (or something that I can read). Also note that talking in small groups will require you to communicate effectively with each other.    Class attendance and participation is important for this course. Please come to our classroom before the time begins and plan to stay until the end of the period. You are welcome to leave the class for short periods of time as necessary. However, arriving to class extremely late or disappearing for long periods of time will be considered as an absence.    Let's do it. Let's talk about AI. No college course is about you turning some pieces of paper that say the right thing for college credit. It is about learning what you need to succeed in your career, becoming an educated and compassionate citizen, and learning how to formulate your own ideas and communicate them effectively. I am not opposed to you using AI appropriately . Here is the general rule for this course: AI should not be used to generate ideas. Use it to correct your grammar. Use it to delve deeper into a topic you want to know more about. Do not ask AI to write out a solution or submission for any assignment. This includes just using it to check an answer. Your submitted assignments should be a representation of how you connect with the material. Using AI inappropriately will be considered a violation of the University's Academic Honesty Policy. If you have any questions about appropriate AI use, please let me know.      Source: https:\/\/www.kent.edu\/today\/news\/adding-ai-cheating-and-plagiarism-policy       I understand that life happens. Sometimes, unexpected things require us to focus on other things. I will keep this in mind regarding attendance and assignment submission. However, I will expect honest, timely, and open communication. If you need to miss a class to attend a major event, let me know ahead of time so we can work something out. Poor communication or ghosting the course are harder things to be flexible about.    Feel safe but avoid safetyism. Safetyism is an obsession with eliminating or avoiding threats (even imaginary ones) to such an extent that you are unwilling to make reasonable trade-offs or accommodations necessitated by practical or moral concerns. It is the belief that it is unhealthy to experience negative emotions. In order to learn, you need to struggle a bit. No one is a master of everything. It's ok to feel confused. It's ok to be disappointed. It's ok to think about things that are a bit uncomfortable. A big part of this course will be reflecting on how you relate to money. I'll tell you now, you're going to have a lot of negative emotions regarding finances over your life. This course will help you prepare for those emotions, but you need to be willing to really think and explore your own mind. Don't withdraw from challenge. Don't hide from life.      "

  "body": " Money and You   Activity: What do you want to learn?   Let's actually get started with personal finance. Here is the thing. Personal finance courses can be pretty ubiquitous. There are some things we'll definitely touch on, but you may have some particular questions about personal finance that you are hoping to explore in this course. I'd like to include some of your questions, if possible. So, your first activity for the course will be   Source: https:\/\/www.fragassoadvisors.com\/ financial-literacy-month\/     to come up with three questions regarding personal finance that you would like to see covered in this course. I'm not promising to answer everything. (I won't tell you what stocks to buy.) But please ask about things you are genuinely interested in.    Small-group conversation: Why do you want to learn financial literacy?  I'm assuming you chose to enroll in this course for a reason. Yes, you earn college credit and tick off one of the Wellness courses. But really, why are you here? Why did you choose this course and why are you interested in personal finance? If you do not want to learn personal finance and are simply stuck here, why do you not want to learn personal finance? Talk with a few people close to you.    Debrief  What I hope we can see is that why personal finance is needed or interesting differs from person to person. It depends on who we are. People who are very future oriented may want to know about how to best prepare for the future. People who are spenders may want to see some techniques for making a paycheck stretch further. People may have heard that certain concepts are important but don't know much about them. There are many more potential reasons to be interested in personal finance. They're all valid.  Notice that this means that there is no singular, concrete goal for this course. We all will appreciate different topics. What is important is that you understand why you are interested in personal finance, and your reason is a good one.    Activity: Money personality quiz   We all have different ways in which we relate to money. Some people despise money and think of it as the root of all evil. Some adore or worship money and wealth. Some are very indifferent to money.   Source: https:\/\/www.bankatfirst.com\/personal\/ discover\/flourish\/money-personalities.html     We all have different ways in which we relate to money. Some people despise money and think of it as the root of all evil. Some adore or worship money and wealth. Some are very indifferent to money. No relationship to money is the right one or the wrong one. However, how you think about money absolutely influences your life, both day-to-day and long term. Setting financial goals is important, but if you try to set goals while ignoring your connection to money, you are likely setting yourself up for failure.  You are going to take a short quiz. There are no right answers. There are points assigned to different options, but points are not necessarily a good thing or bad thing. For each question, do not answer as if anyone will look at these because no one will. Do not answer based on what you think is the most socially acceptable. Really think about each question and be comfortable selecting the answer that best describes you. Please note that this is not an official test. It is just meant to get you to start thinking about your own connection to money.      I would be better off if I had more money.

Money Worshipper. A money worshipper often equates wealth with success or status. They tend not to be shy or anxious regarding finances. They believe that money is an important part of their connection to society. A money worshipper can be either a saver or a spender, but is usually a spender. Positive traits of a money worshipper is that they may have the motivation to work harder to accumulate wealth and may be more charitable. Possible pitfalls of a money worshipper include over-spending, amassing debt, having an unhealthy money fixation, and relationship stresses. Being too much of a money worshipper may mean a belief that accumulating wealth and status supersedes morality or ethics.   Money Avoider. A money avoider tries to avoid thinking or talking about financial issues. The topic of money can make them feel anxious. Sometimes, a money avoider equates wealth with lower morals. The potential benefits of being a money avoider can include making ethical decisions without the influence of money. Unfortunately, avoidance has many pitfalls including a reluctance to budget or plan financially. They may tend to over-rely on others for getting basic needs. A money avoider may also experience relationship stresses regarding finances.   Money Saver. A money saver is more future-oriented and prefers to accumulate money to prepare for the future. The benefits of being a saver include understanding the importance of being financially-prepared, a willingness to budget, and being prudent. The potential pitfalls of being a money saver include becoming a miser or overly-cynical of spending. They may over-stress on finances and refuse to engage in practical spending.   Money Spender. A money spender is more present-oriented and tends to use the money they have rather than save it for later. The benefits of being a spender include being willing to engage in more self-care and being more open to a variety of events or experiences that cost money. Pitfalls include over-spending, lacking discipline to adhere to a budget, and relationship stresses.   Money Indifferent. Someone who is money indifferent does not feel excited or anxious about money. People who are money indifferent generally are either wealthy enough to never have to worry about money, or they have adopted an out of sight - out of mind mentality. Not many people truly fit into this category. Most people get either anxious or excited about money, but they may test into this category if they do not answer truthfully about certain scenarios. Those truly indifferent to money may have an easier time navigating relationships as money is less important to them. However, they may also avoid necessary financial planning.   Source: https:\/\/blog.bankbazaar.com\/ what-type-of-money-personality-are-you\/     There are also some hybrid personalities.'   Money Status. A person who is both a money worshipper and money spender tend to focus on accumulating outward-facing symbols of wealth. They may prioritize buying an expensive car rather than investing their money. They may work very diligently to accumulate wealth. However, they may take on too much risk and may make dangerous social comparisons.   Money Vigilant. A person who is both a money avoider and money saver may be money vigilant. Someone who is money vigilant can be anxious or guarded around topics of personal finance. Benefits include a willingness to save and budget, not overspending on luxury items, and overall prudence. Pitfalls can be becoming a miser or over-stressing about finances.   Money Monk. A person who is both a money avoider and money spender may be a money monk. Someone who is a money monk can feel guilty when they have money. They do not like talking about money, but they are willing to work for it. They tend to spend much of their money on others. Benefits can include less stress in personal relationships and having a charitable spirit. Pitfalls include overspending and being unwilling to save for the future.   Money Hoarder. A person who is both a money worshipper and money saver may be a money hoarder. A money hoarder appreciates wealth and equates it to status. However, they do not outwardly display wealth to others. The benefits of being a money hoarder is a willingness to budget and save for the future. Pitfalls can include refusing to spend on things important for their health and having trouble navigating relationships.  As an example, here are my results: (1,F); (2,A); (3,B); (4,E); (5,E); (6,B); (7,B); (8,E); (9,E); (10,B); (11,B); (12,F); (13,F); (14,D); (15,A); (16,B); (17, B); (18, F); (19, E); (20,E).  So, my point allocation would be: Money Worshipper - 1 point. Money Avoider - 7 points. Money Saver - 7 Points. Money Spender - 5 Points. Money Indifferent - 2 Points.  My dominant personality types seem to be a Money Avoider and a Money Saver. I could then label myself as being money vigilant.     Debrief  What should you take away from this activity? As you explore personal finance and start planning for your present and future, you need to work with yourself. Working against yourself will make financial planning difficult and stressful. For example, if you are a money spender and do not accept that part of your personality, saving and budgeting will be much harder for you. You may find yourself asking, why can't I stop buying X? . If you can identify your relationship to money, it will help you assess what you already do well and what you need to work on.  You cannot change the entire world's connection to money. You cannot change someone else's relationship to money. You can only work on yourself. By understanding how you think about and use money, you can become more mindful of all the emotions that money can bring and be more prepared for them. You want to make sound, prudent decisions about money that will work toward your personal financial goals. You need to truly know yourself to make these decisions.   "

  "body": " Money Psychology  At the end of the day, financial well-being is large a product of the decisions we make with our money. Knowing all about the world of finance the consequences of decisions is not enough to maintain financial health. You must also know why you make the decisions you do. Having an understanding of yourself will help you keep on making sound financial decisions and avoid poor ones.   Money Personality  You have seen a glimpse of money personality and have thought about your own. Your money personality shapes your beliefs and values regarding your finances (and even the whole financial world). These beliefs and values directly affect how you think about money. For example, suppose you have $10,000 saved into an account. A person who is a saver will likely value security over spending and would be more inclined to continue saving or investing that money. A money worshipper may value financial status and be more inclined to spend the money on something like a down payment for a fancy car. A money spender may value exciting experiences and see that money as an international vacation.  The point is that it helps to know yourself around money. Suppose you have that $10,000 and \\textit{know} you shouldn't spend it, but you find yourself unable to stop thinking about all you could buy with it. Realizing that your money personality may drive you more toward spending can allow you to be more mindful of your feelings. Realize that your feelings are not wrong. Feel your feelings. But go with what you know is the best option for you. With practice, this becomes easier and easier.    Money Biases   Everyone is unique, right? Well, some aspects of money psychology are so common that there are names for them. In fact, many advertisements and salespeople utilize some of these aspects to manipulate you into spending your money. We'll discuss these tactics when we explore scams and manipulation.   Source: https:\/\/www.tataaia.com\/blogs\/life-insurance\/10-biases-investors-should-keep-in-mind-when-conducting-investments.html     Generally speaking, a bias is a thought, opinion, practice, etc. that is so imbedded in your brain that it affects your behavior without you realizing it. A bias is not as simple as I like X better than Y. They are subtle, but powerful. Most people are unaware of their biases until those biases are confronted. Even then, many people choose not to accept their own biases. We will go through some of the most common financial biases.   Society Bias. Have you ever thought about needing the latest model of a phone, even though yours still works fine? Is it the extra 26 minutes of battery life? Is it the extra 0.4MP resolution on the camera? No. It's about status. Cellular phones and smartphones have been symbols of status since their creation. (Seriously, look at who bought the first cellular phones.) Status symbols can drive many of us to make purchases that stretch our budgets. Many people buy the largest homes their budgets can possibly afford when a smaller one would be just as functional. Many people dine at expensive restaurants mostly for the opportunity to post a photo of their meal to social media. Similarly, some people buy the latest smartphones so that they can have the largest number available.    Endowment Effect. The endowment effect is less about buying and more about selling. Have you ever run a garage sale (or tag sale for you New Englanders) or tried to sell a car of phone? That feeling you get when you are offered a price less than what you feel is owed is the endowment affect. An interesting commonality in human psychology is that once we own an item we feel as though it is worth more.   Source: https:\/\/customercamp.co\/endowment-effect\/     Imagine this scenario. You buy a car that has a value of $25,000. However, the second you sign the paperwork and own the car, the car's value drops to $20,000 because the car now has a previous owner and has depreciated. How does that make you feel? Are you feeling, Oh, that totally makes sense that my car is worth less ? Or are you feeling, That's bull. If I haven't driven the car, it's still worth what I paid for it ? Probably the latter. The thing with the endowment effect is that it can cause people to hold onto items that they really want to sell. Rather than earning some cash on an item you want to sell, you get no money and need to keep owning your item.    Loss Aversion. One of the workers behind the endowment affect is loss aversion, but loss aversion is a mental bias all its own. In general, people prefer to avoid losing money rather than making gains. Don't believe me? Think about this scenario. You can play a game. You have a 75% chance of winning it. If you win, you double your life savings. If you lose, you lose all your life savings. Do you play the game?   Source: https:\/\/cognitivebias.io\/bias\/loss-aversion     From a mathematical standpoint, the answer is clearly yes! However, most people will not take that bet because of loss aversion. Loss aversion has the potential to make you miss out on financial opportunities and investment gains. Now, a 25% chance of losing your life savings is a bit extreme, but loss aversion can affect much smaller financial decisions. Here's a common example with stocks. When investors see a good gain in a day, they are happy but not shocked. However, when a loss of a similar magnitude happens, the feeling of that loss hits much harder. Many investors will then pull their money out of investments when they see a sudden loss. However, selling a stock when it hits a low is generally not a good idea. (On the other hand, some stocks will continue to decline, and investors may choose not to sell due to loss aversion.)    Anchoring Bias. Here is a huge one that is the foundation of a lot of advertising schemes. (We'll dig in more later as to how.) Anchoring bias is now closely tied to the idea of a sale or deal. Seeing a product being offered for a price less than it was originally can make us want to buy that product, regardless of whether it worth that much.   Source: https:\/\/thedecisionlab.com\/biases\/anchoring-bias     Do you notice that sale tags always tell you the price before the sale. It's to trigger your anchoring bias. There is a lot to discuss regarding manipulation and anchoring, but that will come in a later week. For now, be aware that this bias exists. When making decisions on what to buy, do not concentrate on what was. Concentrate on what is. It doesn't matter that the pack of Oreos is usually $4 and is $3 today. Were you going to buy Oreos anyway? Is $3 the price you're willing to pay?   Present Bias. It is usually easier to concentrate on what you're feeling now compared to what you may feel in the future. Present bias is the concept of living in the present. Living in the present is great for mindfulness, but it can be detrimental to making future plans. Living too much in the present can cause overspending on things you want now rather than saving for the future. Of course, it isn't good to live totally in the future and become a miser. Working with your present bias takes practice and hard work. Your brain is hard-wired to want what you want now. Delaying gratification for a much stronger sense of happiness takes conscious effort. Try to get into the habit of asking what you're giving up by spending money now. By buying the latest model phone now instead of skipping a generation, what financial goals or milestones are you delaying? By ordering that doughnut at Dunkin', what nutritional goals are you giving up? You do not need to sacrifice everything that makes you happy, but you need to have an eye toward the future. Your future self will thank you.   Confirmation Bias. Have you ever scoured the Internet looking for opinions to help you make an important decision? Often, people find a scenario in which most of the information tells them not to make a certain choice, but they only really accept the small bit of information that supports making that choice. This is confirmation bias at work.    Source: https:\/\/qualityedge.com\/articles\/ confirmation-bias\/    Here's an example (not really financial). I am currently debating whether to get surgery on my spine to help with neurological pain. I've been debating this surgery for three years. When I have particularly bad flare-ups, I look for people's opinions and experiences with the surgeries. I find myself much more likely to read stories of successes rather than warnings or bad experiences.   This is likely because that main pain has made me unconsciously decide to get the surgery, and I am looking for confirmation of that opinion. Confirmation bias pops up constantly when making financial decisions. If you find yourself looking at information and only clicking on certain articles, posts, or sites, there is likely confirmation bias at work. It is important to remain objective as you make important decisions and accept all credible information as credible.  Just as a point of reference. Confirmation bias exists everywhere. It is one of the cornerstones of racism, conspiracy theories, homophobia, tribalism, etc. It is a really, really strong bias that every person on this earth has. Being more aware of it can help you make decisions that are actually in your own interest rather than making poor decisions and mentally-manipulating what you see to confirm that poor decision.   Affinity Bias. Related to confirmation bias is affinity bias. Affinity bias can be thought of as brand loyalty that can cause some inefficient financial decisions. For example, many adults ignore cheaper store-brand items in grocery stores (or even refuse to try shopping at a place like Aldi's); they instead only purchase items from brands they recognize. Sometimes there may be sound reasons for this restriction, but often the differences are minimal. For example, many store brand items are actually manufactured in the same factory as name-brand ones. The only difference is packaging.  Affinity bias doesn't have to be objectively bad. Many people make conscious efforts to support or not support certain businesses or products. For example, many people refuse to shop at Walmart, despite it being cheaper, because they do not support the low wages paid to employees or the forced closures of small businesses. What is important is for you to be aware of affinity bias and make conscious choices that fit with your preferences and financial goals.    Herd Mentality. Very much related to social bias is herd mentality. You have likely heard of it before. It's the thing everyone says people different from them follow and is what hipsters claim to be immune to. We are all under the effect of herd mentality. It's easy to see when other people are following a herd, particularly when we don't like that particular herd. It is much harder seeing when you are following a herd.   Source: https:\/\/tecnosoluciones.com\/ marketing-by-influencers-what-is-it-and-how-to-handle-it-correctly\/?lang=en     The consequences of herd mentality in the financial world (and beyond) are many. Herd mentality can cause you to buy something you really don't need or even convince you that you do need an item. It can cause investors to buy stocks that have been on the rise right before a bubble burst. In the modern world, the two most prevalent sources of herd mentality are in rating systems and influencers. Did you most recipe ratings online are fake? Did you know most Amazon reviews on a product are not for the actual product you're interested in? Yet they're important factors in determining our behavior. Speaking as someone who grew up before social media, I cannot tell you how bonkers I find the idea of watching an influencer. Yet followers beget more followers, which is the very concept of herd mentality.    Activity: Think About Your Biases  Pick three of the biases above that you have experienced in some way. (If you think you haven't been influenced by these biases before, think harder.) For each bias, briefly describe a time when that bias affected your thinking or behavior. Briefly reflect on how being mindful of those biases could lead (or have led) to better decisions.    Debrief  One thing to notice is that thinking about weaknesses in the way we think is difficult. That's because of the biggest bias of all - self-bias. We trust our own thoughts more than ones that conflict with them. That's ok; it's part of being human. However, like it or not, biases affect your behavior. Some may be more prone to certain biases than others, but bias is part of the human condition. From a financial standpoint, learning to recognize your own biases can help you make more informed and beneficial decisions about your money.   "

  "body": " Setting Financial Goals   I'm willing to bet you have some financial goals already. Maybe you want to buy a house one day. Maybe you're already thinking about how to retire. Maybe you want to save up for the next Taylor Swift concert. If you have financial goals already, that's great. If not, that's okay too.   Source: https:\/\/www.signaturebankga.com\/ financial-goals-every-small-business-and-entrepreneur-should-have\/      Activity: Preliminary Financial Goals  Before we dive into setting good financial goals, I want you to physically write out at least two financial goals that you have. No restrictions.    STAR Financial Goals  Here is the thing about most financial goals. They usually fail. It's unfortunate, but true. The reason for failure usually isn't bad luck or an economic downturn. Most financial goals are doomed from the start. This is because most financial goals are vague and have no realistic plan behind them. Maybe a financial goal of yours is to be able to buy a house. It is a nice enough goal, but it is vague with no plan. When do you want to buy the house? How will you save up for it? Is your plan realistic?  A good financial goal need to have certain characteristics. We'll use saving for a home as an example.   Specific. A financial goal can't be vague. It needs to be specific. Suppose you would like to buy a house? Depending on the size, location, and type of house you may want, the finances involved will vary wildly. You'll need a down payment, which can be (maybe possibly) as low as 3.5%, but preferably 20%, of the house's value. Maybe the kind of home you're interested in will be worth about $300,000 by the time you buy it, and you want a 15% down payment. Then your more specific goal is, I want save $45,000 to buy a home. This goal is specific.   Timed. Your financial goal should have timing to it. In how long will you achieve your goal? How often will you perform a necessary action to work toward that goal? If your goal is to save $45,000 for a down payment, then ask when will I have that $45,000? and how often will I put money aside for it? For example, you could say, I want to save $45,000 to buy a home in ten years by saving $400 each month.    Achievable. Your financial goal should be achievable. That is, it should possible given your current financial situation. Your goal should not bank on the hope that you will land a seven-figure job. Setting a goal of owning a private island is likely not achievable for anyone in this class without some huge inflow of resources. (Did reading that sentence trigger any emotions in you? Make note, if so.) You cannot simply say, Well, I'll get a job that pays millions. You need to be honest about your limitations. The key question is, What can you manage right now ? Buying an island isn't very likely or reasonable. On the other hand, buying a home is achievable. About two-thirds of Americans live in a home owned by the occupants. (Note that this is not saying that two-thirds of people or families own their homes!)  Consider the goal of saving $400 each month for a house down payment. The question is whether this goal is achievable or not, given the person's current financial situation. If not, the goal may need to be altered, or you may need to change your current financial situation.   Realistic. Similar to being achievable, financial goals need to be realistic. Being realistic includes being abstractly achievable, but it also includes making the saving process more tangible. What I mean is that, for example, saving $400 each month may be well within the realm of being possible or achievable. However, realistically, how will you do it? Perhaps, your goal could be, I want to save $45,000 for a down payment on a home in ten years by saving $200 from each of my biweekly paychecks. Depending on your situation, this may or may not be realistic. If not, can you change some numbers to make it realistic? Maybe the goal could be, I want to save $50,000 for a down payment on a house in fifteen years by saving $135 from my biweekly paychecks.     Activity: Setting STAR Financial Goals  Now is your time to practice. Come up with two financial goals that are specific, timed, achievable, and realistic. They do not need to be lofty like buying a house, but they certainly can be.    Debrief  I want you to notice something about what you may be feeling after thinking about financial goals. If you started thinking about what you can realistically do to save money, you likely started feeling stressed. That is okay. In fact, setting financial goals is usually stressful. However, stress is not always bad. (Look up eustress. ) There are a couple reasons for this stress.   First, a financial goal means you can't have what you want now , and that's tough in today's modern society. Everything can be delivered to your door in 2 days. International trade allows for items to be manufactured at extremely low prices. Our society is built around getting what we want immediately.   Source: https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pulse\/how-manage-financial-stress-anxiety-nonjabulo-sikhakhane     It's stressful to confront the very real fact that you can't always get what you want right away (or ever in some cases). (If you want some context for relatively-recent history of buying stuff, ask your parents or grandparents about ordering from the Sears catalog.) It is important that you learn to confront this stress. The more you practice accepting that some goals take time and effort to achieve, the better you will become at achieving them. It's not a simple thing to do, but it does get easier with practice.  Most financial goals require you to save. Honestly, saving money stinks. Saving money means you have less to spend, which means you need to make some sacrifices in regards to what you buy. For example, one long-term STAR goal I have is to save for my retirement by putting aside the maximum allowed contribution (currently $7,000 a year) into my IRA by depositing $270 from each of my bi-weekly paychecks. It's a good goal, but that goal means I have about $540 each month that I can't spend. Thinking about what I could do with an extra $7,000 each year is stressful. However, with the right mindset and some discipline, I accept that my financial goal takes priority over that extra spending money. Here is one tip. Do not think of saving as a sacrifice. If feasible, think of it as part of your regular budget - something that you need to do with each paycheck. Commit to it with a concrete plan and stick with it. It doesn't take long until saving is a habit.  Perhaps some of you began to actually worry about practically working toward your goals. This may be a sign that your goal isn't achievable or realistic. When a goal requires you to save, the goal should be one that is within your power to work toward. If your goal is too lofty or requires too much financial compromising, you won't be able to stick to it. Remember that it is always better to make slower, healthy progress than fast, unsustainable progress. Burnout is very real.  This debrief is not meant to make you feel stress. It is to help you be mindful of any stress you may feel. Stressing over finances doesn't mean you're goals are bad, and it is okay to feel some stress over them. Work with that stress to formulate and follow STAR goals.    Example of a Goal Going Wrong  I'll give you an example of when I set a financial goal that wasn't a STAR goal and how it ultimately failed.  After I graduated from college and went to graduate school, I really started thinking about retirement. I knew that my IRA would be an important part of my retirement, and I knew that starting retirement savings early would pay massive dividends later on. So, I set the goal of putting aside the maximum allowed amount each year (then $5,000) into my IRA. That was my whole goal. My goal was specific - it was well-defined and gave a particular dollar amount. However, it was not timed, achievable, or realistic. It wasn't timed because I didn't think about how often I would put money aside or how much. It wasn't achievable because I was only making $20,000 pre-tax. If I put $5,000 from my paychecks aside, I would have only had $10,000-$11,000 a year for housing, food, clothing, utilities, etc. Housing and utilities alone were about $8,000 a year. (This was lower-middle class Indiana around 2008.) It wasn't realistic because I did not have a particular way to save money that I could actually stick to.  You might think, well, if he couldn't save $5,000 a year, he probably saved as much as he could. Nope.  To reach my goal, I would have needed to set aside $193 from each of my bi-weekly paychecks, which I simply couldn't do. My brain didn't go to, >well, just save what you can. My brain went to, I can't meet this goal with this paycheck. So, I'll skip it and do it with the next one. Except I didn't. I didn't ever. I occasionally saved money in my IRA - $100 here, $150 there. By the end of my five years in graduate school, I don't think I saved more than $4,000. That's way less than the $25,000 I wanted to save. In hindsight, failing to meet my goals stressed me out. It was easier for me to basically mentally abandon that goal.  What went wrong? My goal was simply impossible with my financial situation at the time. It wasn't a STAR goal. I set my sights too high. My goal should have been, I will save for retirement by depositing $100 from each of my paychecks for the next five years. That I could have managed. It wasn't my first choice of a goal, but it would have been a STAR goal. I could have gotten into a routine of saving that $100 from each check. That would have been $12,000-$13,000 saved by the time I graduated. It doesn't sound like much of a difference from $4,000 in the grand scheme of retiring, but believe me that it does make a huge difference. (We'll explore why in later weeks.)  What should you take from this? Yes, setting financial goals takes work. Yes, sticking to your goal paths takes even more work. But setting unreachable goals and failing to make any progress can be a nasty cycle. A good goal can break you out of those cycles.   "

Take my record player. I bought that in high school. It's a vintage. Nobody has the money to pay what its worth.     Grenda Byesalot walks into a Walmart to pick up some groceries. While walking past the clothes section, she notices a huge Rollback sign indicating that graphic t shirts are now $4 cheaper than they usually are. Grenda reasons that it would be silly not to buy a shirt now because they'll just be more expensive later if she waits.    Gerard is watching one of his favorite Tik-Tok-ers open a package they just received from a sponsor.

We targeted three learning objectives this week: life-long learning, metacognitive reflection, and social-emotional skills. For each of the learning goals, write a few sentences as to how this week's material has helped you progress toward meeting those learning objectives. The three learning goal descriptions are as follows:     Life-long learning: Students practice skills and attitudes central to lifelong learning; including a growth mindset that encompasses self-reflection, flexibility, intellectual curiosity, and considers broad perspectives and diversity of thought.    Metacognitive reflection: Students reflect on their own wellbeing in the context of the course topic and develop metacognitive reflection abilities that work to promote transfer of wellness behaviors and skills. ( Metacognitive means thinking about your own though processes.)    Social-emotional skills: Students identify personal social, emotional, and cognitive skills to be practiced and developed; including self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, responsible decision making, relationship skills, and communication skills.

Source: https:\/\/www.istockphoto.com\/ photos\/saving    Every part of our capitalist society is devoted to trying to get your to spend your money. Our society makes it really easy for you to buy products or services with little to no thought. One of the biggest reasons people go into debt or are unable to ever retire is because they overspend their paychecks.   And it's really easy to overspend. Don't have enough in your bank account for that manicure? Credit card. Need a flashier car? Payment plan. Need a bit of spending cash for the holidays? Cash advance. (These are not advice for these scenarios. Please don't do them. They're just examples of how easier it is the spend money you don't have.) A budget can be a tool that can help teach you discipline and fiscal responsibility. A budget is essentially the backbone or core of financial well-being. It is the foundation upon which other financial skills will be built.  A budget will help track where your money goes. Setting a budget for the first time can be quite eye-opening. Most people find that they spend far more on certain things than they think. A budget will help you set and achieve STAR goals. By putting goals into your budget, you are better set for reaching them. A budget can help payoff your debts or help prevent falling into debt. Debt is expensive, and it generally isn't good to fall into unmanageable debt.  Now, I'll tell you the truth. I do not currently set a budget for myself. I used to, but after getting an intuitive sense of how much I can spend and save each paycheck, I can confidently go through each month without overspending and managing to have an emergency fund for unplanned expenses. This is not because I'm wealthy. I'm the lowest paid associate professor in the Massachusetts state college system. This is because I set a strict budget for myself that I followed until it became habit. When people say they can live comfortably, this scenario is usually what they mean. For most, it doesn't happen overnight. It takes time.  "

  "body": " Budgeting Rules  In this section, we'll explore a few popular budgeting rules. There are general strategies for planning to spend your paychecks. Not all rules will fit everyone's situation, so it can take some trial-and-error to find one that works for you.   The 50-30-20 Rule   Here is the rule. Your after-tax income ( take-home pay ) should be allocated so that 50% is spent on needs, 30% is spent on wants, and 20% is saved. That's it. Let's break down these three categories.   Source: https:\/\/www.infinitysolutions.com\/ blog\/do-you-have-trouble-budgeting-try-the-50-30-20-rule\/      Needs - A need is a necessity that you cannot do without. Housing, utilities, food, supplies, insurance, clothing, and transportation are examples of things considered necessities. Other things can definitely be considered needs, based on your individual situation.   Wants - A want is something that you would like to have but isn't strictly necessary for your survival. Eating out, entertainment, coffee, luxury items, and cosmetics are examples of things considered wants.   Savings - A savings item is simply an account in which you put money you do not spend that can be used for the future. Retirement accounts, savings accounts, and swear jars are all examples of things considered to be savings items.   Sounds simple, right? Here is one of the biggest barriers to the 50-30-20 rule. Most people are reluctant to label some desirable items as a want. Thinking to yourself, I couldn't live without coffee, doesn't make it a need. If you live where there is robust public transportation, owning a car may not be considered a need. Pet supplies are tricky. Is owning a pet a necessity? Most people with pets are hesitant to say no. What about Internet access? It may be a necessity, but is the highest speed possible a necessity?   Source: https:\/\/www.afspa.org\/blog\/ the-importance-of-self-care\/     Here is an important truth. If the thought of not having something makes you uncomfortable, that doesn't make the thing automatically a necessity.   Here some examples of things I've heard from people in my life this particular week (at the time I wrote this section):       I just need Taco Bell for my mental health. It's my comfort food.      I couldn't survive without Door Dash.      We can't live anywhere that won't allow the sweets. ( Sweets are her cats. For context, they've been without housing for a year, and this was in response to an opportunity to get into an affordable place.)      Source: https:\/\/scc.sg\/e\/when-self-care-becomes-toxic\/       Activity: Classifying Spending  Let's practice categorizing things as needs, wants, or savings. For each item\/scenario, classify each as a need, a want, or savings. Pick only one. For each, explain your answer in one sentence.     401-k contributions automatically taken from your paycheck.    Going out to dinner after a really stressful week at work.    Car insurance.    Giving an allowance to your child.    Lottery tickets.    Buying stocks.    A Netflix subscription.    Paying for the repair of your refrigerator.    Cleaning supplies.    A limited-edition collector’s item.    The latest Taylor Swift album.    Child-support payments.       Debrief  We're some of these tricky? I hope so. If fact, you may have come up with different answers as others. Some may even depend on the context you imagine. Here are my answers, in order: savings, want, need, want, want, savings, want, need, need, want, want, need.    Allocating Money under the 50-30-20 Rule  Once you can categorize spending, you can get into the actual meat of the 50-30-20 plan. It can be tedious, and it requires you to have a very detailed and realistic record of your spending. Here is the rough steps in creating your budget.     First, determine how much money you make in a month. (You can also do it by week or by paycheck. However, since bills are usually paid monthly, it is best to budget monthly.) Your paycheck will likely be the biggest source of income, but there may be other sources. Any money that you take in counts. Make sure to only count what you actually get (the “net” amount). For example, if you work a job for 40 hours a week at $21 per hour, your weekly pay is . However, that is not what you actually get because of taxes. To simplify things, if you have an annual salary, take that amount and divide by 12 your monthly pay. If you are paid bi-weekly, multiply your paychecks by 2 to get your monthly amount. For weekly paychecks, multiply by 4. If your paychecks vary from check to check, do your best to come up with a monthly average.    Determine how much you can allocate to each category. For needs, we want 50%of your income. So, take your monthly income and multiply by 0.5. For wants, take your income and multiply by 0.3. For savings, take your income and multiply by 0.2. For example, suppose your monthly income is $3,400. Then you can have devoted to needs, devoted to wants, and put into savings.    Make a list of everything you spend money on in a month. You can group things into categories. For example, don’t list out items from the grocery store. Just have one “groceries” item. This is probably the hardest step. Everything counts. Do you buy a mocha only once or twice a week? That’s $20-$40 from your monthly income that you can’t ignore. Be honest with yourself. It may be necessary to look at your credit card bill or debit card statement to really see where and when you spend money.    Categorize your items as needs, wants, or savings.    Add up how much you spend in each category and compare to what amounts you’re allowed. If you over-spend in a category, you may need to change how your finances work, which we’ll go over shortly. Also note that putting too much into savings is not really grounds for alarm. Only if you feel like you’re not enjoying how you’re spending money should you worry about saving too much.     At the end of this section, I've created a budget spreadsheet you are free to use.    The 80-20 Budget Plan  Sometimes, the 50-30-20 plan doesn't work. This is becoming more true for the millennial, Z, and alpha generations as housing costs are increasing more than wages. It is very common to find yourself in a position where you simply can't allocate only 50% of your paycheck to needs. One solution to that is to >combine needs and wants into one category in which you allocate 80% of your take-home pay to needs and wants and 20% to savings.  Notice something. This version of the 50-30-20 plan essentially lowers the amount for wants in exchange for needs. It still requires you to save 20%. Generally, you should always prioritize saving over wants. It is vastly more important that you save for unexpected future expenses and retirement rather than spend on things you don’t need.  The main benefit of the 80-20 budget is increased flexibility over the 50-30-20.  The increased flexibility of the 80-20 plan does come at a cost. Flexibility allows greater freedom. Greater freedom allows more opportunity to stray from the budget. Simply put, people want wants and do not want to save. It is really easy for the 80-20 plan to become the 100-0 plan. (The 100-0 plan is not a real plan. Please don’t do it.) If you find yourself in a situation where 70%of your paychecks go to necessities like housing, student loans, food, etc., it can be difficult to spend only 10% on stuff you want. Feeling overworked or overstressed can make wants feel like needs.  Under the 80-20 budget plan, you should still classify spending as needs, wants, and savings. it is important for your brain to see that certain spending behaviors are non-essential.    The Envelope System (A.K.A. Cash Stuffing    Source: https:\/\/www.consumerfinance.gov\/ about-us\/blog\/budgeting-how-to-create-a-budget-and-stick-with-it\/    One of the most classic budgeting methods is the envelope system. On social media, this is now often called “cash stuffing.” Traditionally, the envelope system requires you to take your entire paycheck in physical cash and allocate that cash into different envelopes for different spending activities. You could have a “rent” envelope, a “student loan” envelope, a “groceries” envelope, a “Dunkin”’ envelope, a “savings” envelope, etc.   Once you distribute your cash, you do your best not to take money from an envelope for any reason other than its intended purpose. For example, don’t take money out of your “groceries” envelope because you want to go out to eat.  This budgeting method is great for people who tend to over-spend on non-necessities. If you find yourself spending money on things you know you shouldn’t, you can try the envelope method. Physically keeping money in labeled envelope can help you see and adhere to your money’s intended purpose. Further, the process of allocating money physically helps you see exactly where your money is going. If you find yourself transferring money from one envelope to another, you are physically seeing that you’re not sticking to your budget.  One big negative drawback of this system is that it requires you to have your money in cash. However, most bills are paid electronically these days. It also requires you to physically go to a bank or ATM to get cash. Further, your paychecks are usually more frequent than billing cycles. So, you have to learn to put parts of needed bill amounts in an envelope with each paycheck. Also, keeping physical cash around your place can be unsafe.  There are some apps available that can help set up a digital “envelope system.” We’ll discuss budgeting apps later in this week’s material.    The Zero-Based Budget   One of the most classic budgeting methods is the envelope system. On social media, this is now often called “cash stuffing.” Traditionally, the envelope system requires you to take your entire paycheck in physical cash and allocate that cash into different envelopes for different spending activities. You could have a “rent” envelope, a “student loan” envelope, a “groceries” envelope, a “Dunkin”’ envelope, a “savings” envelope, etc.   Source: https:\/\/www.bill.com\/ learning\/zero-based-budgeting     The zero-based budget is a modern update on the envelope system. Under this system, when you get a paycheck, you meticulous give a purpose to every single dollar. So, you do not have just a “savings” category. You would, for example, say “$50 goes into my rainy-day fund. $50 goes into my retire savings. $20 goes into my fund for a vacation.” Beyond paying for your necessities, there are no requirements on how much goes where.  The benefit of the zero-based budget is for you to meticulously track your spending. No dollar goes unaccounted. Many people find it helpful in recognizing over-spending habits and starting to save more.  - First, making more money may be an option. Ask your boss for a raise. Look around for a better-paying comparable job. Take on a small side-gig. You don't necessarily have to throw your arms up and accept not making enough. I know this is easier said than done, but it is a real possibility.   -Suppose you are over-spending in wants. The easiest thing to do is cut back on some of these items that are not essential. Yes, it is uncomfortable saying goodbye to things you get enjoyment from, but it may be necessary. Or perhaps simply altering the want can reduce expenses. For example, going to Chipotle rather than ordering Door Dash will lower that expense. Part of the reason for categorizing things as wants is for you to physically see those things as non-necessities. It can help you make the right, tough decisions.   Source: https:\/\/www.supermoney.com\/12-easy-ways-to-stop-overspending-now     -Suppose you are over-spending in needs but not in other areas. This is fairly common with the current cost of housing. This scenario is tougher, and it is one reason why the 50-30-20 isn’t right for some people. It may require you to make some big changes in your life. Getting a roommate if rent is too high, carpooling to work to save on gas, re-housing a pet to a good home if pet supplies are burdensome, shopping around for better insurance rates, changing Internet providers are all examples changes that could help your needs spending down.  -Suppose you are saving more than 20%of your income. This may not be a bad thing if you are meeting your needs and feel satisfied with how many wants you’re able to fulfill. However, if you are saving so much that you are not paying for your needs or are feeling unsatisfied with what wants you’re able to have, it may be ok to allow yourself to spend more. Of course, depending on your savings goals, saving more than 20%may be a necessary part of the plan.  -If you find yourself over-spending on wants and under-saving, I highly recommend setting up automatic deposits or transfers into a long-term savings account that is separate from your spending\/checking account. This effective forces you to put part of your paycheck aside for savings and giving you a smaller amount to spend each month.   "
